In times like these, it is important to know how to successfully and safely disrupt a hostile or aggressive situation you may witness, and to ensure your actions are more helpful than harmful. This workshop will also explore the role of race and gender during an intervention, and will help provide a space for participants to evaluate their role in high risk situations. \nMore about bystander intervention:\nBystander intervention involves a series of tools that can be consciously employed to defuse volatile situations. In this interactive workshop, bystander intervention and de-escalation will be presented in the context of harm reduction and self-defense. Participants will identify verbal and non-verbal techniques and tactics to de-escalate conflict. Participants will also learn the four Ds of bystander intervention \u2013 direct, distract, delay, and delegate. \nWhat is the format of this training?\nThe training is a combination of instruction as well as participant interaction. Participants will be asked to act out scenarios of intervention, using the skills they have learned.\nIs this training free?\nSuggested donation is $20 for those who are able to contribute. No one will be turned away for lack of pay.\nWhat is the Arab American Association of New York, and why are they offering this session?\nWe are a social service and advocacy agency that serves the largest Arab community in NYC. Leading up to and since the election, our community members - Muslim women in particular, are often the victims of these attacks of aggression and hostility. We want to encourage as many people as possible to safely and successfully intervene in a volatile situation, and catalyze folks to take action in their neighborhoods to protect their neighbors. Bystander intervention is one way to have the back of your fellow New Yorkers.\nWho is welcome to participate?\nThe trainings are open to all - they are not intended exclusively for allies. The training will help us to understand how our race, gender, religion, and other elements of our identity inform how we intervene.\nPlease note: this workshop is open to all, but attendance is capped to ensure the session remains safe and interactive. You *must* RSVP via EventBrite in order to attend. Please note, additional sessions will be scheduled throughout the city at least weekly for the next few months. Contact kayla@arabamericanny.org if you would like to arrange a training in your neighborhood, or for any questions you may have.\n", "html": "<P><SPAN>Trainer: Julia Martin,\u00a0<\/SPAN>The Accompany Project / the Arab American Association of New York<\/P>\n<P><STRONG>Why this workshop?<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P><SPAN>Hate crimes are on the rise across the country, and in NYC there have been multiple incidents of harassment or aggression since elections.

This workshop will teach oral historians and library podcasters how to conduct a strong interview. It can be difficult to get a great recording, and interviewing is an essential element that often gets overlooked. With a few tips and tricks, participants can improve their recording skills to get a deeper result.\nThis workshop will cover the following topics: \n1) microphone placement and recording levels; \n2) writing and structuring thoughtful questions for any project; \n3) what interviewers can do to make their interviewees feel more comfortable; and \n4) the \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d of conducting an interview. The workshop will include a hands-on section where participants write questions and interview each other. If anyone taking the workshop has a project in progress, we can help them with it as a class.\u00a0\n\n\nAbout our facilitator\nJamie Courville has spent the last two decades working with storytelling. Many of those were wearing one hat or another in the film business sassily doing continuity for Muppets, editing video art and documentaries and founding a video collective. These days, she likes to record the voices and faces of people who are seldom heard and share them to make the world a less lonely place. She is ever exploring how to get more voices to more ears. Jamie is also in production of her first feature length documentary Gowanus Current, noting the rapid changes happening to one Brooklyn neighborhood.\n\n\nWhat to bring\n\nA pencil and paper\nAny projects or interview questions that you're already working on\n\n\n\n", "html": "<P><STRONG>A Practical Lesson in Stronger Interviewing for Audio Recording<\/STRONG><\/P>\n<P><BR><\/P>\n<P><STRONG><\/STRONG>Stories make people real instead of statistics. If audio quality is not good, or if interviews do not capture a mood or emotion well, listeners will tune out. To leverage the power of the human voice and reach an audience in a media-savvy world, it makes a difference to get it right.

This is partially due to the fact that existing national and international standards that guide archival description (DACS, ISAD(G)) are designed to be content-neutral, and don't address the unique set of needs inherent to born-digital content. The lack of guidance in this area has resulted in finding aids that vary substantially across--and even within--organizations: different elements are used to express similar information; disparate units of measure are used to indicate size and extent; wording is frequently vague or misleading; and crucial processing information was routinely excluded from finding aids altogether.To improve the clarity, usefulness, and consistency of finding aids across campuses, digital archivists from throughout the University of California system worked together to develop a UC-wide standard standard for born-digital archival description. In addition to establishing a required minimum baseline for archival description in finding aids, these guidelines offer a controlled vocabulary for source media, metadata crosswalks to DACS, EAD, EAD3, MARC, RDA, and ISAD(G), and examples of description for element found within a standard finding. This day-long workshop will introduce participants to the UC Guidelines for Born-Digital Archival Description and enable them to translate this standard into practice at their own institutions. Through a series of hands-on exercises, participants will develop the skill set necessary to create more accurate, transparent, and effective archival finding aids for the born-digital material that they steward. Who should attend:This workshop is for anyone who is currently working or who anticipates working with born-digital material in an archival context. The workshop will ensure that practitioners leave with the skills and resources necessary to adequately express the quality, quantity, and usability of digital material in their collections.
