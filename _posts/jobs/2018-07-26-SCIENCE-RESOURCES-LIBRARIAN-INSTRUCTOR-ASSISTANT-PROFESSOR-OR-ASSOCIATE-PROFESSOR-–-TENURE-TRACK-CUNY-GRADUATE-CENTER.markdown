### Description###

Position Title: 	Science Resources Librarian (Instructor, Assistant Professor or Associate Professor – Tenure track)

Job ID: 	19052

Compensation: 	Competitive

Closing Date:        September 7, 2018


Faculty Vacancy Announcement

The Graduate Center, CUNY is the focal point for advanced teaching and research at The City University of New York (CUNY), the nation's largest urban public university. With over 35 doctoral and master’s programs of the highest caliber, the Graduate Center fosters pioneering research and scholarship in the arts and sciences and prepares students for careers in universities and the private, nonprofit, and government sectors. The Graduate Center’s commitment to research and scholarship for the public good is exemplified by its more than 30 centers, institutes, and initiatives, including its Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), a 200,000 square-foot facility in upper Manhattan, designed to promote collaboration among scientists in five areas of global research and innovation: nanoscience, photonics, structural biology, neuroscience, and environmental sciences.

The Graduate Center (GC) benefits from highly ambitious and diverse students and alumni - who in turn teach hundreds of thousands of undergraduates every year. Through its public programs, the Graduate Center enhances New York City’s intellectual and cultural life.

The Graduate Center Library seeks a Science Resources Librarian. We seek applications from inquisitive and critical librarians with backgrounds in the sciences who are excited to innovate. 

This job consists of two main components: The first is to act as a library liaison for the Graduate Center’s Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), a university-wide facility used by student and faculty scientists from all CUNY campuses. Because research support for the ASRC demands a multidimensional understanding of new initiatives for CUNY, Graduate Center Library resources, and the evolving landscape of scholarly communication in the sciences, the second component of this position involves the management of science resources. Work to this end will involve acquisitions, licensing, administration and promotion of electronic resources at The Graduate Center, in conversation with CUNY-wide science acquisitions via the CUNY Office of Library Services.

The Science Resources Librarian will be a leader and collaborate with ASRC students and scientists to build an innovative collection to support the study of science. The Science Resources Librarian will be a faculty member engaged in the field of librarianship and pursuing research interests for tenure and promotion. This position reports to the Chief Librarian, with daily operations under the guidance of the Associate Librarian for Collections in the Library’s technical services area. 

Duties include but are not limited to:
- Collaborates closely with colleagues working on acquisitions, electronic resources, and serials.
- Serves as a liaison between the Graduate Center Library and the ASRC and other science-focused subjects, performing outreach, providing group and one-on-one instruction, analyzing and building collections, and assisting researchers.
- Leads or contributes to projects related to the life cycle of electronic resources, especially in the sciences.
- Promotes the discoverability of the Graduate Center Library resources both by managing details of library e-resource management systems and by teaching users how to effectively search and retrieve materials.
- Provides leadership in making science acquisition decisions for the Graduate Center Library in collaboration with appropriate entities.
- Provides general reference services at the Graduate Center for Master’s and Doctoral programs in person, by chat, by email, and phone.
