### Description###

The CUNY Graduate Center Library seeks a Science Resources Librarian. We invite applications from inquisitive and critical librarians with backgrounds in the sciences who are eager to innovate. 

This job consists of two main components: The first is to act as a library liaison for the Graduate Center’s Advanced Science Research Center (ASRC), a university-wide facility used by student and faculty scientists from all CUNY campuses. Support for the ASRC requires a multidimensional understanding of the CUNY mission and initiatives, Graduate Center Library resources, and the evolving landscape of scholarly communication in the sciences. The second component involves management of science resources involving acquisitions, licensing, administration and promotion of electronic resources at the Graduate Center. It requires collaboration with CUNY librarians, ASRC science faculty, and CUNY Office of Library Services representatives.

The Science Resources Librarian will lead collaboration with ASRC scientists to build an innovative collection to support the study of science. The Science Resources Librarian will be a faculty member engaged in the field of librarianship and pursuing research interests for tenure and promotion. This position reports to the Associate Librarian for Collections in the Library’s technical services division, with faculty review and academic oversight managed by the Chief Librarian.
