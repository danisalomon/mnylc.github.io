### Description###

The Studio Technician position is a four-month, part-time position with a possibility of extension. This position is open to both early-career and more experienced information professionals interested in supporting the digitization, preservation, production, and creation of analog and digital media.

The position’s responsibilities will include those of a day-to-day operations technician in METRO’s new media studio. The METRO Studio @ 599 is an exciting new experimental hub for librarians, archivists, and curators. It includes equipment for digitizing two- and three-dimensional visual objects, digital forensics and recovery, AV media transfer and digitization, audio recording, and vinyl cutting. The studio equipment meets the needs of METRO’s 260+ members, and it is also available for booking and use by the general public. It is a tool-based, educational resource that puts archival work on display in our office in Hell’s Kitchen. This is a great learning opportunity for students or early-career professionals who are interested in AV digitization, digital forensics, media production and post-production, outreach & education, or project management.

The Studio Technician will report to the Studio Manager. Hours are flexible and dependent on studio bookings, although the Studio Technician can rely on an average of 20 hours of work per week. Most work will be scheduled on Monday through Friday during the work day, but including occasional weeknight and weekend shifts. METRO is willing to work out a flexible schedule that works for all parties. This position would be appropriate for people who have other part-time work or current students. The Studio Technician will receive training on how to use METRO’s equipment, so some comfort and familiarity with technology is helpful, but not prior experience using our specific equipment is required.



### Responsibilities###

Guide and assist all studio patrons on how to use the equipment and complete their projects.

Serve as a digitization technician for projects involving the AV media transfer equipment, scanners, and digital forensics equipment.

Serve as a liaison and contact point for studio patrons.

Coordinate studio scheduling and payments using METRO’s online Planyo system.

Communicate about studio activities on social media and METRO’s blog.



### Qualifications###

Experience with all or some of the following: digitization, archival work, project management, office administration.

Professional or internship experience working in a media / communications company, library, archive, cultural heritage institution, or an affiliated or similar organization.

The ability to communicate with diverse audiences and write clearly.

Familiarity with digitization and/or knowledge of trends and best practices in the fields of digital stewardship and digital preservation.

Facility with contemporary computing systems and relevant software applications.
