For Immediate Release

New York, NY (October 23, 2017) - Brooklyn Public Library, The New York Public Library, Queens Library, and Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) are pleased to announce a new initiative that will bring resources and information regarding digital privacy and data security to New York City’s public library staff. 

**NYC Digital Safety: Privacy & Security** is a partnership between New York City’s three library systems and METRO, a library resources council serving NYC and Westchester County. With support from the City of New York Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer, the project will ensure that NYC residents can rely on public libraries for their questions about internet privacy and security. 

More than 1,000 library staff members throughout each of the three library systems will receive specialized training on online privacy and digital security in spring and summer 2018. Curriculum developed during the course of this project will build on the work done through the Data Privacy Project and will leverage resources developed by the Library Freedom Project, Mozilla Foundation, Tactical Tech, and others. Curricula, toolkits, and facilitation guides will be available for use by the wider librarian, educator, and technologist communities at the conclusion of this project. 

"Now more than ever, New Yorkers need resources to protect themselves as they access the Internet," said Miguel Gamiño, Jr., New York City Chief Technology Officer. "This initiative is a critical component of the City's mission to safeguard privacy and security as we continue to expand internet access to all New Yorkers. I commend all of the library systems and METRO for launching this incredible program."

“Threats to digital privacy are rampant,” said Brooklyn Public Library President and CEO Linda E. Johnson. “It is essential our librarians have the tools and knowledge to help our patrons use computers and other devices safely. Brooklyn Library Public is proud to be part of this critical new initiative on data security.”

“Libraries are universally trusted resources that provide a safe harbor during difficult times,” said Tony Marx, President of NYPL. “NYPL is grateful to be partnering with our fellow library systems, the City, and METRO to ensure all New Yorkers have the knowledge they need to confidently navigate the World Wide Web safely and securely.”

“This initiative will help library staff deliver a higher level of service by showing our customers how to stay safe online,” said Queens Library President and CEO Dennis M. Walcott. “We are grateful to the Mayor’s Office and the Metropolitan New York Library Council for recognizing the power of libraries to promote digital literacy to anyone who seeks it.” 

“We are absolutely thrilled to partner with our colleagues at New York City’s three library systems as well as with the City of New York” said Nate Hill, director of METRO. “As recent events have shown, privacy and security online are incredibly important issues. We know libraries are incredibly well-positioned to act as a resource to help the public protect their data.”

Administrative support for this effort is provided by Metropolitan New York Library Council. The program’s advisory council includes representatives from Mozilla Foundation, Data & Society, the New America Foundation, and the Library Freedom Project.
