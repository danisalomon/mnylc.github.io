Our culture is overwhelmed with instances of incorrect information in many forms. From foreign actors to our social connections, misleading and often dangerous information has seemingly co-opted our online and offline spaces.

On Thursday, May 31 and Friday, June 1 METRO will host a symposium on the nature of falsified information. We’ll investigate the (social) media environment that allows incorrect information to thrive, seek a better understanding of the actors behind these events, and wax philosophical about the current state of counterfeit information and what this foreshadows about the library, archives, and museums community. And we’ll tease out concrete actions to take to better information our communities and ourselves.

We're now accepting presentation proposals for this symposium. Ideas for presentation topics include but are definitely not limited to:

- Counterfeit information in its various forms (propaganda, disinformation, misinformation, etc.)
- Historical perspectives on falsified news
- Explorations of how journalism is impacted by dis-intermediated information
- The role of emotion and attention in these issues
- The actors behind mal-information and what their goals might be
- The impact of falsified news on our communities
- Ideas for how we might play a role in clarifying these issues for our communities

Please [apply to present](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQh-LvJ1mZDz_F864YCqZnRaWuAh78EcwvaY1Pncblg3OLIg/viewform?usp=sf_link) by midnight on Friday, April 13. Selected presentations will be notified on or by April 27.

We are also seeking individuals who would like to join our planning committee for this event. In addition to reviewing and selecting proposals to be presented day-of, you’ll be asked to provide feedback on how we might build interaction and dialogue into this event. We're offering a small stipend; please [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyHnol-OsVbekksAU000rZxV4MwMH-45gDdc5XjsicFXUdfA/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Friday, March 30.

A quick note about our symposium series: METRO has moved to a new facility with a state-of-the-art events space, and this year we will be hosting topic-driven events here at 599 11th Avenue in lieu of METROcon. For more information on why we made this decision, please email us at events@metro.org.
