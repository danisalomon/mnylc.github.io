The Staten Island Museum recently completed a project to digitize two periodicals published by Women's Suffrage organizations in the 1910s, courtesy of a METRO digitization (micro)grant which covered scanning of the materials by Internet Archive. Over 6,000 pages/scanned images from The Woman Voter and The Suffragist are now publicly available online.

The Woman Voter was published by the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City between 1910 and 1917. It described itself as follows: “the only magazine published in the interests of the New York State Campaign for woman suffrage. It contains official news of the work, authoritative statements on policy by officers of The New York State Woman Suffrage Party, and general articles by well-known writers.” The paper covered news of the campaign for suffrage in each district in New York City. It listed the officers of each chapter of the Women’s Suffrage Party within the city. It reported the results of party elections, and featured profiles of individual suffragists. Activists for the cause contributed opinion pieces, updates about planned activities, and lists of major donors in support of the cause.

The Suffragist was the weekly newspaper of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage. It was published between 1913 and 1920 and covers national and international news of the movement.
