Opened in 2015, the center is a newly constructed 14,000 square foot collection storage space. It houses the museum’s collection artifacts and their growing archival collections, including books, documents, photographs, media, architectural and engineering drawings. The center is open by appointment only one day a week to researchers, making this is a great opportunity for A.R.T. and METRO members.



**The Cloisters - Friday, December 9, 3:30 p.m.**
Join Jeanne-Marie Musto for a guided tour of the Cloisters on this limited-edition tour. Our visit will focus on the rare items found in the Treasury.
