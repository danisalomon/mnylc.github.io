Columbia University will host Fedora Camp on Monday, November 28th through Wednesday, November 30.

Fedora Camp offers everyone a chance to dive in and learn all about Fedora 4. Training will begin with the basics and build toward more advanced conceptsâ€“no prior Fedora 4 experience is required. Participants can expect to come away with a deep dive Fedora 4 learning experience coupled with multiple opportunities for applying hands-on techniques working with experienced trainers and Fedora gurus.

We're excited to note that METRO's Digital Repository Developer, Diego Pino, will co-facilitate the Fedora In-Context: Front-Ends session at 1:30 p.m. on November 28.
