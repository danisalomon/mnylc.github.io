What does it mean for libraries, archives, and museums to serve the public interest in a cultural environment in which profit is all-important? What pressures do we face in a money-driven world, on an institutional level and as individuals? 

In 2018, METRO will host a series of symposia to discuss pressing issues in our field, starting with a day-and-a-half long conversation on Libraries in the Context of Capitalism. Taking place at METRO on Thursday, February 1 and Friday, February 2, this event seeks to unpack the tensions that exist for libraries and archives as cost centers in a neoliberal economic climate.

We're now accepting presentation proposals on facets of library & archives work as it currently exists within a market economy. Ideas for presentation topics include but are definitely not limited to:

* Economic systems and their effects on libraries
* Information as a commodity
* Student loans and the LIS field
* The ethics of unpaid internships
* Money, social power, and class

Please [submit your presentation proposals](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmBkltSdy_cpgL4sHj9OO2-aLYtWdbgEQMLMAwG7m5NSWrAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by midnight on Friday, October 13.

We are also seeking individuals who would like to join our planning committee for this event. In addition to reviewing and selecting proposals to be presented day-of, youâ€™ll be asked to provide feedback on how we might build interaction and dialogue into this event. We're offering a small stipend; please [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSej-LkFvPVE3YPvUro9SL1w3-r4C0I8YEcqk1FfRPyqbvjD3Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Friday, September 15.

A quick note about our symposium series: METRO has moved to a new and beautiful space, and this year we will be hosting topic-driven events here at 599 11th Avenue in lieu of METROcon. For more information on why we made this decision, please email us at events@metro.org.
