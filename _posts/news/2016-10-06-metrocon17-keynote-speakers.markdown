We're excited to announce the two keynote speakers we will hear from at METRO's 2017 Annual Conference.

**Jeff Goldenson** is the Library Director at Olin College of Engineering and a creative placemaker. He's been a design researcher in variety of contexts: from the MIT Media Laboratory to EdLab at Columbia University to the Harvard Library Innovation Laboratory. He takes an experimental approach as Library Director while maintaining a deep respect for the founding mission of libraries. The Olin Library is an interdisciplinary hub for research, creativity, mixed-media events, and storytelling.

**Marie Oestergaard** is Head of Community Engagement, Partnerships and Communication, Dokk1 / Project Leader of Dokk1, Aarhus, Denmark.
Since 2001, Marie has been part of Aarhus Public Libraries’ development of the physical library of the future. Focusing on interactions, user-involvement, network-development, prototyping and communication in the physical library space, Aarhus has investigated new technologies, involvement processes and learning. In a wide range of projects and processes with users, network and partners Marie has focused on the development of the “next library” – the library of the future.
