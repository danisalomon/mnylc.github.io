CLRC and METRO, with support from NN/LM MAR and in partnership with The Taubman Health Sciences Library at the University of Michigan, are pleased to announce that we are now accepting applications for Systematic Review workshops in NYC and Syracuse.

_Systematic Reviews: Opportunities for Librarians_ will provide information professionals with foundational knowledge about systematic reviews. The course includes an opportunity to engage in high-level discussions about involvement in Systematic Review (SR) projects. Participants will participate in an online component for two weeks, followed by an two-day in-person training in either NYC or Syracuse.

Participants will build a toolkit of resources and strategies, as well as an action plan, to help foster greater involvement in systematic reviews at their institution. This course is accredited for 20 MLA CE credits.
Events take place on the following dates; each two-day workshop (NYC & Syracuse) is limited to 25 participants:

* Online Component (all participants): April 3-16, 2017
* New York, NY: April 17-18, 2017
* Syracuse, NY: April 20-21, 2017

The cost for two weeks of training is $100 per participant.

Preference will be given to applicants working at institutions based in New York State.
