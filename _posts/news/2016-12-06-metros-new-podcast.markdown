Our new podcast Library Bytegeist debuted on November 15! Hosted by METRO Fellow Molly Schwartz, [Library Bytegeist](https://soundcloud.com/librarybytegeist) is a collection of audio stories about the libraries, archives, and museums of New York City.

The first episode features our three METRO's Fellows -- Molly Schwartz, Katie Martinez, and Karen Hwang -- in an informal discussion about their projects and their thoughts on working in the cultural heritage sector in New York City.

Episode 2 highlights a conversation with MoMA's Ben Fino-Radin on media conversation, plus a bonus factoid about which obsolete format is Ben's favorite.
