      Introducing Historypin’s Storybox: Community Memory and Social Change
      Historypin’s Storybox, launching in June 2018, is a unique story sharing program that brings people together to ask big questions, share the stories of life, and illuminate the things we have in common.
      In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate hands-on story sharing sessions designed to be run in libraries and community organizations, and look at some of the science and methodologies behind this approach.
      Learning outcomes include: how to facilitate community conversations around shared local history; how to utilize a theory of change to measure social impact in library civic engagement programs; why story sharing is more effective than information-based treatments in driving attitude change.
      Session agenda:

      4:00-4:10 PM, Intro to Historypin and Storybox
      4:10-5:00 PM, Abbreviated story session
      5:00-5:10 PM, Break
      5:10-5:40 PM, Methods behind Storybox and a variety of ways to design civic engagement programs in your community
      5:40-6:00 PM, Q&A


      About our instructor:
      Based in New Orleans, Jon is the Director of  Shift Inc (US), part of a global non-profit that designs consumer products and builds social ventures to help solve social problems. He is also Strategic Partnerships Director for Historypin, where more than 4,000 cultural heritage organizations are working to strengthen communities through intergenerational and intercultural storytelling and local history.
      Jon co-founded the International Linked Open Data in Libraries, Archives & Museum Summit in 2011 to help build an open ecosystem of historical data across libraries, archives, and museums worldwide.

      About our facilitator:
      Raul Enriquez is the technology & training manager at New America’s Resilient Communities Initiative. As an educator, he believes a classroom should be visceral, safe, and collaborative. Enriquez also believes food is the ideal conduit for ideas to flow throughout a community. Let's have a potluck. We'll talk. Prior to New America, Enriquez was the computer teacher at The Doe Fund in NYC. While there, he taught men with histories of homelessness, incarceration, and substance abuse the value of computer literacy, computer arts, and CompTIA A+ certification. As a guest artist, he taught graduate courses at NYU Tisch School of the Arts and at CalArts | California Institute of the Arts. When left alone, Enriquez engages in aural/moving image arts, siesta, and culinary buffoonery.

      Working in the Digital Art Landscape

      This workshop will teach the basics of operating within a creative landscape that requires manipulation and creation of assets for print and digital media. Participants will gain an overall understanding of the tools available in Adobe’s Creative Suite and how they work together to create usable, quality content.

      Need to edit a photo, prepare files for a printer, or make a GIF? The workshop will cover:
      Photoshop Basics - Uses and Goals

      File Setup: Sizing and Resolution
      Photo Editing: Non-Destructive Editing and Adjustments

      Illustrator Basics - Uses and Integration

      Raster vs Vector: Best Practices and Use Cases
      Workflows between Creative Suite Applications

      Indesign Basics - Layout and Integration

      Formatting for Print


      By the end of the class, participants will be able to work within the Creative Suite and format content for various platforms. While we plan to walk through a project that touches upon all of the above areas, participants are encouraged to bring questions related to their own work or design initiatives.

      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Please have Adobe Creative Suite pre-loaded. If you don't own a license, you can download a free, 7-day trial version of Creative Cloud here.

      and SAIC professor. BLT’s primary aim is the production of discursive sites,
      wherein cultural producers engage in dialogue on a variety of critical issues.
      BLT has taken the form of salons, peer teaching workshops, meet-ups, Wikipedia

      Teaching Research Data Management and Reproducibility: Ways to Engage Your Community in Research Stewardship

      By understanding researchers' workflows, teaching data management is that much more efficient. In this session, Vicky Steeves (Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, New York University) will give an introduction to those looking to start offering services around research data management and reproducibility.
      Steeves will introduce the concepts, terminology, and best practices of data management and reproducibility from both the perspective of librarians and researchers. Steeves will also demonstrate existing open-source infrastructure and workflows that enable best practices in data management and working more with more reproducibility. Participants will experiment with online tools, engage in discussions, and work on small group activities. Folks walking away from this workshop will have a better idea of how to engage with researchers on these topics, offer more research services, and foster a community of stewardship within their institutions.

      Learning objectives:

      Participants will gain an understanding of some basic concepts in data management and reproducibility
      Participants will know about available tools that help work towards research reproducibility
      Participants will understand how to offer and scale services around data management and reproducibility
      Participants will be able to, at the very least, know what to look up when Googling


      This is an introductory workshop; no prerequisite knowledge or experience is required.

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)

      to be a part of NYC Open Data week this year!\nJoin us on Wednesday, April 25th
      for a workshop on a critical element of NYC’s open data sets: the data dictionary.
      Home to key information written by data owners, data dictionaries communicate
      elements of each data set: column names, descriptions, and values.\nThis workshop
      will present a crash course on working with NYC Open Data sets and their accompanying
      data dictionaries. We will learn how data dictionaries are created and build
      mechanisms to improve the quality of these important resources. With librarians,
      and NYC Open Data coordinators together in one room, we’ll work together to
      improve the usability and accessibility of NYC’s open data.\nJoin us for:\n\nA
      quick briefing on how to access and use data dictionaries\nA discussion with
      representatives from the City on creating data dictionaries \nA hand-on exercise
      to offer feedback on how these valuable resources can be improved for public
      use\n\nThis workshop is ideal for public librarians who are interested in helping
      their patrons access NYC Open Data and academic librarians who may have had
      experience with data dictionaries in scholarly work. \nCoffee, tea, and snacks
      will be provided. Please feel free to bring a brown bag lunch.\n\nWhat to Bring:\n\nA
      laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)\n\nFacilitator Biography:Julia

      With her firm, Tiny Panther Consulting, she brings data librarian services to
      the public, teaching data literacy workshops and helping socially-minded organizations
      collect and analyze data with the communities they serve. Julia commutes around
      NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the
      balance of power in data-driven research.\n\nWorkshop fees:Fees for this event
      are $40 for METRO members and $80 for non-members. If you’re in need of a subsidized

      <P>METRO is thrilled to be a part of NYC Open Data week this year!</P>
      <P>Join us on Wednesday, April 25th for a workshop on a critical element of NYC’s open data sets: the data dictionary. Home to key information written by data owners, data dictionaries communicate elements of each data set: column names, descriptions, and values.</P>
      <P>This workshop will present a crash course on working with NYC Open Data sets and their accompanying data dictionaries. We will learn how data dictionaries are created and build mechanisms to improve the quality of these important resources. With librarians, and NYC Open Data coordinators together in one room, we’ll work together to improve the usability and accessibility of NYC’s open data.</P>
      <P>Join us for:</P>
      <UL>
      <LI>A quick briefing on how to access and use data dictionaries</LI>
      <LI>A discussion with representatives from the City on creating data dictionaries </LI>
      <LI>A hand-on exercise to offer feedback on how these valuable resources can be improved for public use</LI>
      </UL>
      <P>This workshop is ideal for public librarians who are interested in helping their patrons access NYC Open Data and academic librarians who may have had experience with data dictionaries in scholarly work. <BR></P>
      <P><SPAN>Coffee, tea, and snacks will be provided. Please feel free to bring a brown bag lunch.</SPAN></P>

      Intro to Code: Javascript, data, and poetry
      This workshop is a beginner-friendly introduction to coding as a hands-on, sketch-driven exploration of basic computer concepts. We'll use Javascript to learn how to create data types and program control flow (i.e., loops, if statements), how data enters and exits a computer, and to build a basic understanding of computing concepts. Awareness of the shifting boundary between human and computer language teaches us how computers excel and how we can shape the flexible parts of our ideas to make our lives easier. The workshop will culminate with writing our own Markov chains and poetry zines generated from literary texts from Project Gutenberg.

      Students will learn the basic vocabulary of computer code, basic javascript, how to make an interactive HTML page, and how to parse and store data that comes in from the internet.

      This workshop is for students who have experience with computers like using a keyboard and navigating your way around folders. However, no coding experience is required.

      Topics covered will include:


      What is code? Human and computer languages


      Peeking inside of files - the rich text file format


      HTML and CSS in under 5 minutes


      3 things computers can do in a program: storage, algebra/compare, and control flow


      Interactive javascript applications inside of HTML files



      Text games


      Drawing with the mouse



      Fetching data from the internet with JQuery


      Generative content with Markov chains



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Windows, Mac, or Linux are all good. Chromebooks won't work as local file storage is required.Please have the following two programs pre-loaded:



      Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/


      Chrome Browser: https://www.google.com/chrome/




      About our instructor:
      Robby Kraft is an creative engineer and instructor at Parsons School of Design and the School for Poetic Computation. He codes creative interactive visualization tools and installations and works on new origami designs and the mathematics of folding.

      Understanding Data on the Web:data traces, Tor browser, and SecureDrop

      In this workshop, we'll talk about some of the physical parts of the internet and how they fit together. We'll look at our own data traces to see what snoopers and our ISPs can see when they look at our web traffic. We'll spend the last section of the workshop talking about how the Tor browser hides some of the data traces that would otherwise visible. We'll also cover a few specific uses of the Tor browser, including submitting documents securely and anonymously to newsrooms via SecureDrop.
      During this workshop, we'll:
      - Use cards with pictures of different pieces of internet infrastructure (router, ISP, etc.) to lay out how the internet works.- Download a few applications that let us dive deeper into how information travels across the internet:


      A packet sniffing application called Herbivore (if you don't know what "packet sniffing" is, don't worry! We'll talk about it in the workshop)


      The Tor browser


      - Walk through one specific use of the Tor browser: using it to submit documents securely and anonymously to news outlets and non-profits

      Learning outcomes include:


      Participants know how the basic building blocks of the internet—including routers, ISPs, servers, and data packets—fit together


      Participants have an understanding of the digital data traces we create when we use the internet


      Participants know how to use Tor and can decide when it makes sense to use based on the situation



      Prerequisite knowledge and/or experience:


      What’s assumed: Basic computer fluency, including how to browse the web and download free software from the internet.  


      We’ll learn together: Basics of internet infrastructure, like what role a router plays in getting a webpage to our computer; what a "data packet” is; what metadata is; what we mean when we talk about security and anonymity online.



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). Herbivore, which we’ll download and demo during the workshop, only works on Mac computers, but we’ll briefly discuss an alternative for Windows.All software options we’ll look at are free.


      About our instructor:Jen Kagan is a programmer, writer, and teacher. She's a recent graduate of NYU-ITP, where she's currently a research resident, and she's also a tech fellow at Coworker.org.

    text: "Getting Started with Web Archives:A beginners' workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs
      our subjects, stakeholders, patrons, and donors increasingly engage each other
      and the world through online media, librarians and archivists are compelled
      to steward valuable born digital records into cohesive, preservable collections
      for future access and use. Web archiving--the process of collecting, preserving,
      and enabling access to web materials--presents a powerful opportunity for us
      to develop collections of these otherwise ephemeral resources. The most difficult
      step towards realizing this potential is often simply getting started; the daunting
      range of possible collecting scopes, policies, technologies, and workflows can
      stop a web archiving program before it starts. How does one define an achievable
      collecting mission, communicate their selection standards, and appropriate the
      necessary technical, human, and financial resources, without any practical experience
      in this emergent craft?Attendees to this workshop will overcome these obstacles
      with training and support from experts in the practice. The program will begin
      with a survey of web archiving that establishes a common level of understanding
      and language, progresses through case studies that represent the judgements
      and decisions to be made in designing a web archiving program, and conclude
      with a guided small-group exercise to design and make the first acquisitions
      into a model web archive.Specific learning objectives to this end include: understanding
      the nature and history of web archives as born digital collections; how to craft
      a mission-driven collection development policy for web archives; how to select
      among the available acquisition tools and descriptive standards to best support
      their patrons’ and stakeholders’ needs; and best practices for long-term preservation
      and access to these resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to bring:\n\n\nA laptop

      web archives through software support, training, testing, and documentation,
      as a web archivist for the Internet Archive’s Archive-It service. His boundless
      enthusiasm for all things web archiving developed during his term as a National
      Digital Stewardship Resident with the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC).
      He has served as the founding co-chair of the Art Libraries Society of North
      America’s Web Archiving Special Interest Group and chair of the Society of American
      Archivists’ Web Archiving Section. Select publications include “A collaborative
      model for web archiving ephemeral art resources at the New York Art Resources
      Consortium” (with Sumitra Duncan in Art Libraries Journal, 2016) and “Digital
      Preservation Metadata Practice for Web Archives” (with Clément Oury & Sébastien
      Peyrard in Digital Preservation Metadata for Practitioners, 2016). Karl earned
      his BA in History of Art from Haverford College and his MS in Library and Information
      Science from Drexel University.\n\nSamantha Abrams is Web Resources Collection
      Librarian at Ivy Plus Libraries, where she coordinates the partnership's Web
      Resources Collection Program. Now in its first year, the Program is a collaborative
      collection development effort to build curated, thematic collections of freely
      available, but at-risk, web content in order to support research at thirteen
      participating Ivy Plus Libraries and beyond. Before Ivy Plus Libraries, Samantha
      worked at StoryCorps, where she managed the organization's digital and physical
      assets, including born-digital audio and photos, physical paperwork, and electronic
      databases. Samantha has additional experience working in public libraries, publishing,
      and as a corporate archivist for the fast-casual restaurant chain Culver's.
      She is the current Social Media Coordinator for the Society of American Archivists'
      Web Archiving Section, and in 2014 she was awarded the Future Steward Award
      by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance, which recognizes emerging leaders
      taking a creative approach to advancing the knowledge of digital preservation
      issues and practices. Samantha earned her Bachelor's in English from the University
      of Iowa, and her Master's in Library and Information Studies from the University
      of Madison-Wisconsin.\n\n\n"

      Photography & Photoshop Essentials, Part 1:Essential Lighting Techniques for 3D Objects and Flat Art
      This session, originally scheduled for March 15th, will now take place on Thursday, June 21st.
      We are putting more and more of our cultural heritage objects online as digital images. Learn how to photograph 2- and 3- dimensional objects in a way that captures and enhances the detail and beauty of the originals. In this session we will cover techniques that you can apply to online exhibits, promotional materials, or digitization work.
      The first in a series of three workshops centered on photography and photoshop, this session will give participants an introductory understanding of essential lighting techniques for 3D objects and flat art. Topics covered will include:


      Understanding light


      Types of light sources


      Direct light vs. diffused light


      Lighting techniques for three-dimensional objects


      Lighting techniques for two-dimensional objects and flat art


      No prerequisite knowledge or experience is required for this session. Students are encouraged to bring their own cameras in order to participate in hands-on exercises throughout the workshop.
