      CS First is a free, easy-to-use computer science curriculum that is designed
      to engage a diverse student population in grades 4-8 (ages 9-14). During this
      3-hour training, you will use modular videos to teach kids foundational computer
      science concepts and coding basics with Scratch, a block-based coding tool.
      Whether you have never felt like a \"techy\" or you would like to build upon
      prior skills, we encourage you to attend!\n\nPlease be sure to bring a laptop
      with you to this training. Contact tom.bijesse@mouse.org if you do not have

  description:
    text: "We all know that workshops and one-shots have varying degrees of success
      meeting students’ information literacy needs. Attendance, student engagement,
      and faculty buy-in are all impediments to success. What if you could turn your
      ideas into a multi-session course, giving you control of the curriculum and
      learning outcomes? During this day-long workshop intended for academic librarians,
      participants will take a topic they are interested in and turn it into a multi-session
      course. In the morning we will focus on course development, including determining
      learning outcomes and scaffolding assignments. In the afternoon we will focus
      on pedagogy, including creating lesson plans and leading a class session. We
      will also brainstorm ways to adapt this model to individual environments (based
      on needs, resources, staffing strengths/limitations, etc.). This workshop is
      hands-on. Participants are asked to come with an idea for a class in mind (for
      example: What is something you are interested in teaching more in-depth? What
      is a skill faculty say students are lacking? What topic would add to your school's
      curriculum?), as well as an internet-enabled device for independent and group
      work (laptop, tablet, etc.). Participants will come away with a rough syllabus
      for a multi-session course, a few lesson plans/assignments geared towards their
      topic, and an understanding of how to facilitate class sessions. \n\nWhat to
      bring:\n\n\nA laptop or other internet-enabled device\n\n\n\nOr click here to

      McGuire is the Outreach Librarian at the Alumni Library at Bard College at Simon’s
      Rock in Great Barrington, MA. She has worked and volunteered at public, high
      school, and academic libraries in NY and MA. She has taught classes at the high
      school and undergraduate level both in-person and online, as well as numerous
      workshops for patrons of all ages. Most recently, she helped develop an information
      studies curriculum at Simon’s Rock consisting of ten, one-credit, half-semester
      (seven week) courses taught by librarians that provide opportunities for students
      to develop metaliteracy and resilience within academia and beyond. KellyAnne
