    html: '<p>Please join us at our Fall 2017 Library Resource Sharing: Interlibrary
      Loan Meetup (formerly the METRO ILL SIG!)</p> <p>We''ll have an open forum for
      interlibrary loan librarians and other parties interested in posing interlibrary
      loan related questions or sharing their latest ideas and resources. Please send
      us any agenda items you’d like to discuss.</p> <p>The event will be held at:</p>
      <p>The new METRO Training Center (8th floor)</p> <p>599 Eleventh Avenue (between
      44th Street and 45th Street)</p> <p>Please note, the METRO Interlibrary Loan
      SIG and the METRO Circulation and Reserves SIG are combining to become the Library
      Resource Sharing: Circulation, Interlibrary Loan and Reserves MeetUp group.
      In this way, new groups can be accommodated by METRO, and you will get more
      information about our shared interests through a shared MeetUp page and emails.
      We will also make it clear to everyone which meetings are focused on Interlibrary
      Loan and which are focused on Circulation and Reserves so that you can attend
      either one (or both, if you like!). This meeting will be focused on Interlibrary
      Loan, but everyone is welcome.</p> <p>If you are in the ILL MeetUp you will
      see a change in our title. If you are in the Circulation and Reserves group
      you will need to sign up for the Library Resource Sharing: Circulation, Interlibrary
      Loan and Reserves MeetUp group.</p> <p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Interlibrary-Loan-Interest-Group/"><a

    html: The Universal Elements of Good Design
  description:
    text: "Everything in our lives was designed by someone, from the alarm that wakes
      us up in the morning to the book we read before going to bed. Across the myriad
      of objects, tools, and apps that we use every day, they were designed using
      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and
      sound. \nIn this three-hour workshop, we’re going to break up our time into
      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and
      review a variety of real world print and interactive examples to discuss how
      they impact the final design. Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
      and put them into practice together.\nNo previous design experience required
      to participate. This workshop is great for those that have an interest in design
      but have had little to no previous training.\nBy the end of this workshop, participants
      will have:\n\n\nAn understanding of the fundamental building blocks every designer
      uses in their work to create effective and compelling visual designs\n\n\nHow
      to use these fundamental building blocks to design for print and screen\n\n\nHands-on
      practice establishing designing and leveraging space, typography, color, and
      motion, and sound to create a unique visual language\n\n\n\nAbout our Instructor:Magera
      Holton, Co-founder at Related Works believes the best design is the one you’re
      least likely to notice. She most recently managed the Design Systems Team at
      Etsy, responsible for building core UX components and design guidelines utilized
      by product teams every day across the organization. She managed Buyer Experience,
      which focused on streamlining the purchasing experience and bringing Etsy’s
      unique content to the forefront. \nAs an individual contributor at Etsy, she
      patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows:
      checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at
      Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling
      the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not
      thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over
      renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.\n"
