    text: "Trainer: Julia Martin, The Accompany Project / the Arab American Association
      of New York\nWhy this workshop?\nHate crimes are on the rise across the country,
      and in NYC there have been multiple incidents of harassment or aggression since
      elections. In times like these, it is important to know how to successfully
      and safely disrupt a hostile or aggressive situation you may witness, and to
      ensure your actions are more helpful than harmful. This workshop will also explore
      the role of race and gender during an intervention, and will help provide a
      space for participants to evaluate their role in high risk situations. \nMore
      about bystander intervention:\nBystander intervention involves a series of tools
      that can be consciously employed to defuse volatile situations. In this interactive
      workshop, bystander intervention and de-escalation will be presented in the
      context of harm reduction and self-defense. Participants will identify verbal
      and non-verbal techniques and tactics to de-escalate conflict. Participants
      will also learn the four Ds of bystander intervention – direct, distract, delay,
      and delegate. \nWhat is the format of this training?\nThe training is a combination
      of instruction as well as participant interaction. Participants will be asked
      to act out scenarios of intervention, using the skills they have learned.\nIs
      this training free?\nSuggested donation is $20 for those who are able to contribute.
      No one will be turned away for lack of pay.\nWhat is the Arab American Association
      of New York, and why are they offering this session?\nWe are a social service
      and advocacy agency that serves the largest Arab community in NYC. Leading up
      to and since the election, our community members - Muslim women in particular,
      are often the victims of these attacks of aggression and hostility. We want
      to encourage as many people as possible to safely and successfully intervene
      in a volatile situation, and catalyze folks to take action in their neighborhoods
      to protect their neighbors. Bystander intervention is one way to have the back
      of your fellow New Yorkers.\nWho is welcome to participate?\nThe trainings are
      open to all - they are not intended exclusively for allies. The training will
      help us to understand how our race, gender, religion, and other elements of
      our identity inform how we intervene.\nPlease note: this workshop is open to
      all, but attendance is capped to ensure the session remains safe and interactive.
      You *must* RSVP via EventBrite in order to attend. Please note, additional sessions
      will be scheduled throughout the city at least weekly for the next few months.
      Contact kayla@arabamericanny.org if you would like to arrange a training in
      your neighborhood, or for any questions you may have.\n"

      Improving Descriptive Practices for Born-Digital Material in an Archival Context
      Creating archival finding aids for born-digital that adequately express the quality, quantity, and usability of the material has been challenging for digital archives practitioners. This is partially due to the fact that existing national and international standards that guide archival description (DACS, ISAD(G)) are designed to be content-neutral, and don't address the unique set of needs inherent to born-digital content. The lack of guidance in this area has resulted in finding aids that vary substantially across--and even within--organizations: different elements are used to express similar information; disparate units of measure are used to indicate size and extent; wording is frequently vague or misleading; and crucial processing information was routinely excluded from finding aids altogether.To improve the clarity, usefulness, and consistency of finding aids across campuses, digital archivists from throughout the University of California system worked together to develop a UC-wide standard standard for born-digital archival description. In addition to establishing a required minimum baseline for archival description in finding aids, these guidelines offer a controlled vocabulary for source media, metadata crosswalks to DACS, EAD, EAD3, MARC, RDA, and ISAD(G), and examples of description for element found within a standard finding. This day-long workshop will introduce participants to the UC Guidelines for Born-Digital Archival Description and enable them to translate this standard into practice at their own institutions. Through a series of hands-on exercises, participants will develop the skill set necessary to create more accurate, transparent, and effective archival finding aids for the born-digital material that they steward. Who should attend:This workshop is for anyone who is currently working or who anticipates working with born-digital material in an archival context. The workshop will ensure that practitioners leave with the skills and resources necessary to adequately express the quality, quantity, and usability of digital material in their collections. The workshop has broad applicability, and will accommodate participants who have minimal experience with processing digital material as well as those who have been working with born-digital materials for some time.
      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)

      Shira Peltzman is the Digital Archivist for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Library, where she leads the development of a sustainable preservation program for born-digital archival material.

      is thrilled to be a part of NYC Open Data week this year!\nJoin us on Wednesday,
      March 7 from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. for a workshop on a critical element
      of NYC’s open data sets: the data dictionary. Home to key information written
      by data owners, data dictionaries communicate elements of each data set: column
      names, descriptions, and values.\nThis workshop will present a crash course
      on working with NYC Open Data sets and their accompanying data dictionaries.
      We will learn how data dictionaries are created and build mechanisms to improve
      the quality of these important resources. With librarians, data journalists,
      and NYC Open Data coordinators together in one room, we’ll work together to
      improve the usability and accessibility of NYC’s open data.\nThis workshop will
      build trust, understanding, and shared values between librarians and NYC’s Open
      Data managers – the beginnings of a beautiful partnership. We will:\n\n\nGive
      briefings to librarians and data managers about each others’ strengths and roles.\n\n\nConduct
      a collaborative exercise to build collective understanding around the process
      by which data dictionaries are created and their usefulness in understanding
      a dataset.\n\n\n\n\nBegin a conversation around how and where people can provide
      feedback about how to improve current and future data dictionaries.\n\n\nThis
      workshop is ideal for public librarians who are interested in helping their
      patrons access NYC Open Data and academic librarians who may have had experience
      with data dictionaries in scholarly work. \nCoffee, tea, and snacks will be
      provided. Please feel free to bring a brown bag lunch.\n\nWhat to Bring:\n\nA

      the public, teaching data literacy workshops and helping socially-minded organizations
      collect and analyze data with the communities they serve. Julia commutes around

    text: |-
      At the heart of librarianship is unpredictability: in the age of shelves, borrowers chose, read, and interpreted books for themselves, rather than according to a librarians' agenda. We are not teachers or preachers, but facilitators of users' access to the universe of knowledge and culture. How do we adapt those values of unpredictability and profound user-centredness to library services in an age of live events and digital services? How can these values help us to challenge the culture of fake news by stoking curiosity and challenging authority?
      Library Island is a workshop centred on a live-action simulated roleplay with practical take-homes, forcing us to rethink service development, innovation, and our strategic vision for libraries' future. It draws on theories of Information Experience (IX) which integrate evidence-based practice and design thinking, using techniques deployed across health bodies, public libraries, and higher education in the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
      Information Experience embraces uncertainty, amplifies diverse perspectives, and focuses on relationships and empathy, rather than services or products. Visit Library Island to learn more about this approach and how to apply it in playful, pragmatic ways across your service.
      Attendees will:


      Become familiar with the Information Experience approach and its application in digital & physical library offerings, including using IX to address the culture of fake news


      Learn to use and adapt fast, practical, cost-effective approaches to solicit and develop plans, visions, and missions which can be embraced by staff and stakeholders alike


      Be able to develop their own open-ended roleplay sessions, suited to their own institutions & communities 


      About our facilitatorMatt Finch (matthewfinch.me) works with communities, companies, and institutions to help them do useful and surprising new things. Currently serving as a Creative/Researcher for the British Library, Matt has devised everything from spooky time-travel games in Ann Arbor, USA to a season of burlesque in New Zealand’s biggest city and live zombie battles in rural Australia. He is also co-author of the new strategic vision for the future of public libraries in Queensland, Australia, and a strategic consultant to universities & healthcare providers.
      Fees$40 for METRO members / $80 for non-members
      ScholarshipsFull scholarships are available for this event. Please apply here by February 15.
      Testimonials“Matt’s “Battle for Library Island” roleplaying event opened many minds to the challenges and tensions of library service, allowing both brand-new personnel from the finance department, and old public service hands who thought they fully understood their work, to rapidly see things they do every day from a totally different perspective. Library Island is a brilliantly fun and simple simulation of an entire community that is as fun and engaging as it is insightful and thought-provoking.” – Eli Neiburger, Deputy Director, Ann Arbor District Library, USA
      “Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. Matt’s ability to adapt his presentation and activities to make it relevant and to cater for the needs of his audience is commendable. His twist on the “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s mind to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. The workshop was attended by clinical and non-clinical staff from executive level management to admin support staff and was deemed extremely successful by all staff members who attended the workshop.” – Javed Khan, Engagement Coordinator (Planning, Engagement, and Reform) – Metro South Health Board, Queensland, Australia

      Registration Open: ISLE & Islandora Hack/Doc, March 12-13 in NYC
      THIS IS NOT SOLD OUT! Registration is open for an Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)-themed hack/doc, March 12-13 at METRO. Attendance is free and space is limited (note that we are currently asking that no more than two people from any single institution register at the moment). Registration will be open until March 5th. Feel free to contact Martha, mtenney@barnard.edu with any questions.
      Register HERE.
      What is ISLE?
      Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) is a new project in development that will address two of the most significant pain-points in Islandora--installation and maintenance--using Docker containers. ISLE is supported by a variety of (mostly small) institutions who have Islandora installations. For more information, click here.  
      What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
      A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon--bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time--with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
      What will we be doing?
      Plans for the hack/doc are still being formed, but on one of the days you can expect to be introduced to Docker and use ISLE to spin up a full Islandora 7x stack (documentation and friendly ISLE teachers included). Other activities may include improving ISLE testing and documentation; creating workflows for the maintenance of ISLE installations; and discussions about migration, future phases of the ISLE project, coordinating ISLE with Islandora CLAW, and a planned "liberal arts sprint" to develop more robust institutional repository features in Islandora. Finally, you can expect to meet folks, build networks, and personally help to make ISLE more responsive and useful for the Islandora community.
      What about the venue/food/travel/etc.?
      We will follow up with schedules, any do-ahead work, and any other necessary information for registered attendees. For more logistics information, please follow this space: https://goo.gl/mdsyyo.

      How to Take the Lead: Leveraging your role as a problem-solver in your institution
      The facilitators of this session will use their own experiences to help participants fill the role of “internal consultants,” employees who “influence [their institutions] through credibility, expertise, skills, knowledge and understanding and to change something.” The workshop will offer practical methods of:· Filling the role of an internal consultant· Explaining your value to committees that solve problems and take advantage of opportunities· Identifying, understanding, and solving the institutions' problems and opportunities to help the institution realize their full potential· Helping find solutions by, for example, searching the literature and facilitating brainstorming sessions with other employeesThis session will consist of an hour-long interactive talk by Sheryl Ramer and Deborah Goss, who have begun to view themselves as internal consultants, followed by several short presentations by librarians who have helped institutions to solve problems.
      Abour Our Instructors
      ​​Sheryl Ramer is Director of the health science library at New York City Health + Hospitals / Elmhurst. She is an integral member of the hospital’s Workforce Development committee, which promotes employee engagement, and the Collaborative Care committee, which improves patient experience. Sheryl identified the need for and piloted a program with CE Direct, an online educational product for health care professionals. The pilot persuaded the administration to purchase CE Direct for all hospital employees. She will soon be featured in the hospital newsletter describing her continuous quality improvement in the library and her work with the 3D printer, which was purchased with a grant from METRO.
      Deborah is the Chief Medical Librarian at NYC Health + Hospitals/Queens, where she has worked for the past 6 years. Recently, she has become involved in hospital-wide initiatives to apply strategic deployment to population health management. Her professional interests include healthcare delivery reform & information discovery in the digital age. She currently serves as President of BQSIMB Health Sciences Librarians.



      This event is co-sponsored by METRO and BQSIMB (Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Manhattan and the Bronx Health Sciences Librarians). To learn more about BQSIMB, visit their website at http://www.bqsimb.org/.
