    html: Bystander Intervention 101 Workshop
  description:
    text: "Trainer: Julia Martin, The Accompany Project / the Arab American Association
      of New York\nWhy this workshop?\nHate crimes are on the rise across the country,
      and in NYC there have been multiple incidents of harassment or aggression since
      elections. In times like these, it is important to know how to successfully
      and safely disrupt a hostile or aggressive situation you may witness, and to
      ensure your actions are more helpful than harmful. This workshop will also explore
      the role of race and gender during an intervention, and will help provide a
      space for participants to evaluate their role in high risk situations. \nMore
      about bystander intervention:\nBystander intervention involves a series of tools
      that can be consciously employed to defuse volatile situations. In this interactive
      workshop, bystander intervention and de-escalation will be presented in the
      context of harm reduction and self-defense. Participants will identify verbal
      and non-verbal techniques and tactics to de-escalate conflict. Participants
      will also learn the four Ds of bystander intervention – direct, distract, delay,
      and delegate. \nWhat is the format of this training?\nThe training is a combination
      of instruction as well as participant interaction. Participants will be asked
      to act out scenarios of intervention, using the skills they have learned.\nIs
      this training free?\nSuggested donation is $20 for those who are able to contribute.
      No one will be turned away for lack of pay.\nWhat is the Arab American Association
      of New York, and why are they offering this session?\nWe are a social service
      and advocacy agency that serves the largest Arab community in NYC. Leading up
      to and since the election, our community members - Muslim women in particular,
      are often the victims of these attacks of aggression and hostility. We want
      to encourage as many people as possible to safely and successfully intervene
      in a volatile situation, and catalyze folks to take action in their neighborhoods
      to protect their neighbors. Bystander intervention is one way to have the back
      of your fellow New Yorkers.\nWho is welcome to participate?\nThe trainings are
      open to all - they are not intended exclusively for allies. The training will
      help us to understand how our race, gender, religion, and other elements of
      our identity inform how we intervene.\nPlease note: this workshop is open to
      all, but attendance is capped to ensure the session remains safe and interactive.
      You *must* RSVP via EventBrite in order to attend. Please note, additional sessions
      will be scheduled throughout the city at least weekly for the next few months.
      Contact kayla@arabamericanny.org if you would like to arrange a training in
      your neighborhood, or for any questions you may have.\n"

    text: "Using and Improving NYC Open Data DictionariesNYC Open Data Week 2018\nMETRO
      is thrilled to be a part of NYC Open Data week this year!\nJoin us on Wednesday,
      March 7 from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. for a workshop on a critical element
      of NYC’s open data sets: the data dictionary. Home to key information written
      by data owners, data dictionaries communicate elements of each data set: column
      names, descriptions, and values.\nThis workshop will present a crash course
      on working with NYC Open Data sets and their accompanying data dictionaries.
      We will learn how data dictionaries are created and build mechanisms to improve
      the quality of these important resources. With librarians, data journalists,
      and NYC Open Data coordinators together in one room, we’ll work together to
      improve the usability and accessibility of NYC’s open data.\nThis workshop will
      build trust, understanding, and shared values between librarians and NYC’s Open
      Data managers – the beginnings of a beautiful partnership. We will:\n\n\nGive
      briefings to librarians and data managers about each others’ strengths and roles.\n\n\nConduct
      a collaborative exercise to build collective understanding around the process
      by which data dictionaries are created and their usefulness in understanding
      a dataset.\n\n\n\n\nBegin a conversation around how and where people can provide
      feedback about how to improve current and future data dictionaries.\n\n\nThis
      workshop is ideal for public librarians who are interested in helping their
      patrons access NYC Open Data and academic librarians who may have had experience
      with data dictionaries in scholarly work. \nCoffee, tea, and snacks will be
      provided. Please feel free to bring a brown bag lunch.\n\nWhat to Bring:\n\nA
      laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)\n\nFacilitator Biography:Julia
      Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working
      at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement.
      With her firm, Tiny Panther Consulting, she brings data librarian services to
      the public, teaching data literacy workshops and helping socially-minded organizations
      collect and analyze data with the communities they serve. Julia commutes around
      NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the
      balance of power in data-driven research.\n\nWorkshop fees:Fees for this event
      are $40 for METRO members and $80 for non-members. If you’re in need of a subsidized
      ticket in order to attend this event, please email us at events@metro.org.\n\n"

  description:
    text: |-
      At the heart of librarianship is unpredictability: in the age of shelves, borrowers chose, read, and interpreted books for themselves, rather than according to a librarians' agenda. We are not teachers or preachers, but facilitators of users' access to the universe of knowledge and culture. How do we adapt those values of unpredictability and profound user-centredness to library services in an age of live events and digital services? How can these values help us to challenge the culture of fake news by stoking curiosity and challenging authority?
      Library Island is a workshop centred on a live-action simulated roleplay with practical take-homes, forcing us to rethink service development, innovation, and our strategic vision for libraries' future. It draws on theories of Information Experience (IX) which integrate evidence-based practice and design thinking, using techniques deployed across health bodies, public libraries, and higher education in the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
      Information Experience embraces uncertainty, amplifies diverse perspectives, and focuses on relationships and empathy, rather than services or products. Visit Library Island to learn more about this approach and how to apply it in playful, pragmatic ways across your service.
      Attendees will:


      Become familiar with the Information Experience approach and its application in digital & physical library offerings, including using IX to address the culture of fake news


      Learn to use and adapt fast, practical, cost-effective approaches to solicit and develop plans, visions, and missions which can be embraced by staff and stakeholders alike


      Be able to develop their own open-ended roleplay sessions, suited to their own institutions & communities 


      About our facilitatorMatt Finch (matthewfinch.me) works with communities, companies, and institutions to help them do useful and surprising new things. Currently serving as a Creative/Researcher for the British Library, Matt has devised everything from spooky time-travel games in Ann Arbor, USA to a season of burlesque in New Zealand’s biggest city and live zombie battles in rural Australia. He is also co-author of the new strategic vision for the future of public libraries in Queensland, Australia, and a strategic consultant to universities & healthcare providers.
      Fees$40 for METRO members / $80 for non-members
      ScholarshipsFull scholarships are available for this event. Please apply here by February 15.
      Testimonials“Matt’s “Battle for Library Island” roleplaying event opened many minds to the challenges and tensions of library service, allowing both brand-new personnel from the finance department, and old public service hands who thought they fully understood their work, to rapidly see things they do every day from a totally different perspective. Library Island is a brilliantly fun and simple simulation of an entire community that is as fun and engaging as it is insightful and thought-provoking.” – Eli Neiburger, Deputy Director, Ann Arbor District Library, USA
      “Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. Matt’s ability to adapt his presentation and activities to make it relevant and to cater for the needs of his audience is commendable. His twist on the “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s mind to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. The workshop was attended by clinical and non-clinical staff from executive level management to admin support staff and was deemed extremely successful by all staff members who attended the workshop.” – Javed Khan, Engagement Coordinator (Planning, Engagement, and Reform) – Metro South Health Board, Queensland, Australia

      make people real instead of statistics. If audio quality is not good, or if
