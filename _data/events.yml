      Code, Craft & Catalogues: Arts in the LibrariesWhat role do the arts and design play in today’s libraries? Our major public institutions frequently commission high-profile public art, some libraries feature dedicated exhibition space, and artists and designers have long drawn inspiration from archival and library collections. Yet today, as we access and create knowledge through an expanding array of designed platforms and interfaces, infrastructures and algorithms, aesthetic operations are integral to the core services that libraries provide. We see a growing number of library- and archive-based artists’ residencies and exhibitions, and expanding interest in more sustained collaborations across the library and art worlds. In this symposium we gather librarians, artists, designers, and representatives from allied fields to examine recent examples of library-centered creative practice, discuss the mutual benefits of such collaborations, and propose new models for growing and sustaining these partnerships.

      <P><SPAN>Bring your hard drives. Bring your laptops. Bring your Dropbox password. We’re going to preserve your podcast.</SPAN></P>
      <P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>If you’ve listened to our podcast or read our zine, you know that podcasts are disappearing. So how can podcasters protect themselves against loss?

This interactive workshop will </SPAN><SPAN>tackle this issue head-on by walking audio creators through the history of podcast technology, the basics of archival preservation, and simple steps you can take to preserve your audio. We will review through the tools and techniques to prevent data loss before it’s too late, as well as “bake” these concepts into podcasters’ existing production workflows.</SPAN></P>

      Please join us for a special tour of La MaMa Archives! 
      Established in the early 1970’s, La MaMa Archives collects, preserves, and exhibits records of permanent historical value relating to La MaMa and the Off-Off Broadway movement. In doing so, it draws on a deep vein of in-house institutional memory, the passionate community of artists whose work has found a home on La MaMa stages, and a diversity of scholars, educators and international artists with whom we regularly collaborate.
      La MaMa’s archival collection includes over 50,000 unique items–posters, programs, costumes, puppets, and photographs, scripts, correspondence, and audiovisual materials– that together chronicle the institution’s fifty-plus year history.

      This event is open to METRO members only. If you'd like to join METRO, please visit metro.org/join.


      We are offering this event free of charge; participants are encouraged to bring along a small cash donation to help support the La MaMa's work.
