    html: '<p>#NoHateALA: What’s next for our community?</p> <p>This summer, the ALA
      put forth an amendment to the Library Bill of Rights that sanctioned hate groups
      meeting in public libraries, sparking outrage from many in our profession and
      the communities we serve. While the amendment is now rescinded, we''re still
      troubled by its implications.</p> <p>Join us for our next discussion topic:</p>
      <p>Recap of this summer’s events<br/>Discussion of how to move forward<br/>What
      role does ALA play in shaping and representing our profession?<br/>What opportunities
      do we have to influence the ALA to take a political stance and actively oppose
      both structural racism and hate groups?</p> <p>Background reading:</p> <p><a

  description:
    text: "The recipe for successful public programming at a library is complex. It
      is a mixture of knowing your community, keeping track of trends, advance planning,
      marketing, project management, and persistence. The devil is truly in the details.\nPublic
      programming allows library staff to bring a variety of opportunities for learning,
      engaging, entertaining, and building connections across all age groups to the
      communities we serve. Programming has seen tremendous growth in the last decade
      in terms scope and variety and has become a core service to the mission of libraries.
      Planning and running programs is no longer something extra to be done in spare
      time. Like any other core service, it requires careful planning, tracking and
      evaluation.\nThis practical workshop will examine current trends in programming
      for adult audiences at public libraries and also explore a variety of project
      management techniques that can be used to ensure that all goes smoothly during
      every phase of planning.\nThis workshop will demonstrate and examine the following
      topics:\n\n\nMethods for evaluating current programs and key steps to creating
      a long range programming plan\n\n\nProject management forms that allow for organization
      and tracking of multiple programs\n\n\nAssessment tools that allow for collection
      of both qualitative and quantitative data about programs\n\n\nCurrent trends
      in programming for adult audiences at public libraries\n\n\nNo previous experience
      or knowledge is required.\n\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper\n\n\n\nAbout
      our instructor:\nJanie Hermann, in her role as Public Programming Librarian
      at the Princeton Public Library, oversees the more than 2,000 public programs
      put together by the amazing team she is privileged to work with. Her work at
      the library allows her to interact with a wide variety of local groups and organizations
      and she is dedicated to ensuring the public programs offered at the library
      not only meet but exceed the expectations of the Princeton community. She was
      named an LJ Mover and Shaker in 2007, has served on the NJ State Library’s Blue
      Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Libraries and is involved in many capacities
      with ALA, most notably as chair of the Programming Librarian Interest Group.
      As a teacher, librarian, wife and mother, Janie has learned that minute details
      can have a big impact and that planning is crucial, but you still have to leave
      room for some spontaneous actions.\n\n"

      Every hospital has problems to solve and opportunities to take advantage of. They need to improve patient care and satisfaction and prepare for surveys by The Joint Commission and other accrediting bodies. Nurses need to pass required courses and study for certifications and doctors need to pass their boards. Employees need to be engaged to improve recruitment and retention. As information professionals in hospitals and healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to identify issues and find ways to be pro-active in addressing them. In this session, we will explore potential information gaps and hear from vendors who sell relevant products that may be unfamiliar to many librarians.

    text: "Building Solidarity: Supporting Community Organizations through Archival
      Practice\nFor the past several decades, community archives such as the Lesbian
      Herstory Archives, Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project, and the Freedom
      Archives have been important sites of self-determination, memory, and inspiration
      for historically disenfranchised communities. In recent years, archivists and
      information workers have become increasingly interested in using their professional
      skills to support these projects. This workshop will discuss what community
      archives are and why they are important. We will review key scholars, discuss
      ethical considerations, and explore the effects of privilege in this work. Key
      tools and techniques, such as records management, DIY digitization stations,
      and non-hierarchical practice will be examined. In the afternoon, we will partner
      with local NYC organization Asian American Arts Alliance to create a thoughtful
      plan for the long-term stewardship of their records. Participants will leave
      the workshop with a theoretical grounding in the current activist and professional
      conversations around community archives, knowledge about how LIS professionals
      can support this work, suggestions for practical tools, and experience putting
      these tools into practice.\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper or personal
      laptop for notetaking\n\n\n\nAbout our instructors:\nAnjali Goyal is an arts
      administrator and has worked with various community-based arts nonprofits for
      the past 15 years. She is currently the Development Manager at the Asian American
      Arts Alliance in Brooklyn, NY. Marie Lascu is a graduate of NYU's Moving Image
      Archiving and Preservation program. She has been a member of the XFR Collective
      since 2015, and works as the audiovisual archivist for Crowing Rooster Arts,
      a media non-profit that has spent more than 20 years documenting the arts and
      political struggles of Haiti. Maggie Schreiner is an archivist at the Brooklyn
      Historical Society, and has been a volunteer with Interference Archive and Librarians
      and Archivists with Palestine since 2013. She is a graduate of NYU's Archives

      Do you face challenging behavior from library users? 
      Would you like to change, develop, or enhance relationships with patrons, colleagues, or stakeholders?

      This session explores the use of simple, inexpensive, and effective activities that build empathy, highlight obstacles to change, and help participants to find common ground for future action. We'll highlight the elements of scenario planning, collaboration, and storytelling that underpin those activities.

      Participants will:


      learn to use open-ended play activities including Library Island to elicit new ideas, highlight challenges, and develop relationships


      create a tailored roleplay of their own


      explore follow-up activities that turn play into practical outcomes


      Participants will receive a follow-up packet with additional resources, hints, and tips.

      Testimonials“Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. Matt’s ability to adapt his presentation and activities to make it relevant and to cater for the needs of his audience is commendable. His twist on the “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s mind to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. The workshop was attended by clinical and non-clinical staff from executive level management to admin support staff and was deemed extremely successful by all staff members who attended the workshop.” – Javed Khan, Engagement Coordinator (Planning, Engagement, and Reform) – Metro South Health Board, Queensland, Australia
