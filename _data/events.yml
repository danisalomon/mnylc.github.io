      We invite you to a lecture and collection tour of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Hamm Archives. The Hamm Archives tell the 150-year history of BAM, but they also tell a story of the people and communities—civic and artistic—that made BAM what it is today. The Archives provide a rich and unique resource for those interested in BAM artists, the history of performing arts in the U.S., and in Brooklyn's social history.Comprised of approximately 3,000 linear feet of documents and photographs dating from 1857 to the present, the Archives includes items such as playbills, posters, architectural plans, administrative files, production records, press clippings, and video. The collection is housed at the BAM Hamm Archives Center in a modernized facility at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights.The visit will include a talk on the unique materials held in the Hamm Archives, as well as projects undertaken for the recent launch of the Leon Levy Digital Collection, the Archives’ online digital collection containing over 25,000 images and documents.
      Please note that this event is open to METRO institutional and individual members only. There is no fee to attend, but registration is required.

      <p>Managing research data with non-relational databases<br/>Seth Kaufman, developer,
      Whirl-i-Gig, Brooklyn, NY</p> <p>For decades relational databases have been
      the go-to tool for managing large data sets despite their structural limitations.
      In recent years there has been an explosion of options based on alternative
      “non-relational” data models that promise improved performance, scalability
      and ease of development. In this talk we’ll review the design and development
      of two data management applications built on these alternative models: (1) ePandda:
      an API providing access to over 60 million correlated paleontological data entries
      and (2) Inquisite: a user-focused platform for capture, preservation and dissemination
      of humanities research data. We will discuss the approaches considered and selected
      for these projects, and the real-world experiences operating these graph and
      document-oriented systems.</p> <p>About Seth<br/>Wanting to develop robust open-source
      collections management solutions as an alternative to the expensive, inflexible
      commercial options available to museums, archives and other collecting institutions,
      Seth founded Whirl-i-Gig in 1995. His background includes training in civil
      engineering, computer science and graphic design, all pursued at the Cooper
      Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York—where he also taught
      digital design and programming for seven years. Since 2003, Seth has been the
      lead developer and architect of CollectiveAccess, an open-source application
      for museum and archival collections management that is in use at scores of institutions
      across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.<br/>Join the Code4Lib NYC

    text: "Join us at METRO for this three-part organizing workshop, taking place
      on:\n\nThursday, October 11th from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM;\nThursday, October 18th from
      11:00 AM - 2:00 PM; and\nThursday, October 25th from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM\n\n\nIn
      this workshop, participants will learn concrete strategies for building skills,
      utilizing resources, and creating networks to challenge and reimagine structures
      of power in their communities. In three sessions, organizers from the Prison
      Library Support Network (PLSN) will lead attendees through the steps of organizing,
      from idea to action. While it is not required to attend all three sessions,
      previous activities will frame future ones. If you know that you will miss a
      session, please let us know so we can provide you with the relevant exercises
      to complete to keep you up to speed. Attendees are not required to have any
      previous experience with organizing and are welcome (but not required) to bring
      personal laptops to work on. Session 1: Assessment, Planning & Research This
      session will cover the initial steps of developing an organizing practice through
      self-reflection, capacity/asset mapping, and research. We will analyze the social
      and economic context in which we work, exploring how our work interacts with
      broader structures of violence, white supremacy, colonialism, and our cultures.
      By the end of this session, participants will:\n\nDevelop a common definition
      of organizing and shared process for analyzing and responding to the needs of
      our community \nCultivate understanding of collective research strategies and
      analysis that can be used to develop a deeper understanding of the historical
      and current context of an issue and further identify allies, threats, and critical
      resources to support with organizing efforts\n\nSession 2: Collaboration & ActionIn
      this session, we will define effective strategies and multiple action tactics
      that create meaningful outcomes. We will also discuss internal organizational
      structures and practical connection building.By the end of this session, participants
      will:\n\nBuild awareness of strategies used by community organizations and activists
      who are organizing across intersections \nCarry out a process for assessing
      potential partnerships and organizing campaigns/actions\n\nSession 3: Evaluate
      and SustainThe final session will culminate in learning methods for effective
      maintenance of your organizations and projects through the process of designing
      relevant evaluation criteria and group reflection.By the end of this session,
      participants will:\n\nUnderstand how to establish and sustain collective work\nDiscern
      opportunities for connection, power building and resistance \n\nAbout PLSNThe
      Prison Library Support Network is an information-based collective that aims
      to redistribute resources and provide support to incarcerated people. Our work
      is rooted in our recognition of systematic violence that the prison industrial
      complex creates. We believe that information is a tool for prison abolition,
      and that we must create space for people who want to commit and redistribute
      their own capacities and resources.\n\nAbout our instructor:\nMia Bruner’s work
      seeks to activate archival and library collections as sites of public dialogue,
      collective power, and resistance. Right now, she works as a Librarian at Pratt
      Institute Libraries, organizes with PLSN, and is building a radical queer subject
      thesaurus at the Lesbian Herstory Archives. Emma Karin Eriksson’s personal and
      professional ideology is one of intersectionality, respect, and DIY. She is
      currently receiving her MLIS with a focus in critical instruction, library outreach,
      and community support. \n"

    html: Planning for Programming Success
  description:
    text: "The recipe for successful public programming at a library is complex. It
      is a mixture of knowing your community, keeping track of trends, advance planning,
      marketing, project management, and persistence. The devil is truly in the details.\nPublic
      programming allows library staff to bring a variety of opportunities for learning,
      engaging, entertaining, and building connections across all age groups to the
      communities we serve. Programming has seen tremendous growth in the last decade
      in terms scope and variety and has become a core service to the mission of libraries.
      Planning and running programs is no longer something extra to be done in spare
      time. Like any other core service, it requires careful planning, tracking and
      evaluation.\nThis practical workshop will examine current trends in programming
      for adult audiences at public libraries and also explore a variety of project
      management techniques that can be used to ensure that all goes smoothly during
      every phase of planning.\nThis workshop will demonstrate and examine the following
      topics:\n\n\nMethods for evaluating current programs and key steps to creating
      a long range programming plan\n\n\nProject management forms that allow for organization
      and tracking of multiple programs\n\n\nAssessment tools that allow for collection
      of both qualitative and quantitative data about programs\n\n\nCurrent trends
      in programming for adult audiences at public libraries\n\n\nNo previous experience
      or knowledge is required.\n\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper\n\n\n\nAbout
      our instructor:\nJanie Hermann, in her role as Public Programming Librarian
      at the Princeton Public Library, oversees the more than 2,000 public programs
      put together by the amazing team she is privileged to work with. Her work at
      the library allows her to interact with a wide variety of local groups and organizations
      and she is dedicated to ensuring the public programs offered at the library
      not only meet but exceed the expectations of the Princeton community. She was
      named an LJ Mover and Shaker in 2007, has served on the NJ State Library’s Blue
      Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Libraries and is involved in many capacities
      with ALA, most notably as chair of the Programming Librarian Interest Group.
      As a teacher, librarian, wife and mother, Janie has learned that minute details
      can have a big impact and that planning is crucial, but you still have to leave
      room for some spontaneous actions.\n\n"
