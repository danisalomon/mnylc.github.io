      on working with NYC Open Data sets and their accompanying data dictionaries.
      We will learn how data dictionaries are created and build mechanisms to improve

      the City on creating data dictionaries \nA hand-on exercise to offer feedback
      on how these valuable resources can be improved for public use\n\nThis workshop
      is ideal for public librarians who are interested in helping their patrons access
      NYC Open Data and academic librarians who may have had experience with data
      dictionaries in scholarly work. \nCoffee, tea, and snacks will be provided.

      At the heart of librarianship is unpredictability: in the age of shelves, borrowers chose, read, and interpreted books for themselves, rather than according to a librarians' agenda. We are not teachers or preachers, but facilitators of users' access to the universe of knowledge and culture. How do we adapt those values of unpredictability and profound user-centredness to library services in an age of live events and digital services? How can these values help us to challenge the culture of fake news by stoking curiosity and challenging authority?
      Library Island is a workshop centred on a live-action simulated roleplay with practical take-homes, forcing us to rethink service development, innovation, and our strategic vision for libraries' future. It draws on theories of Information Experience (IX) which integrate evidence-based practice and design thinking, using techniques deployed across health bodies, public libraries, and higher education in the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.
      Information Experience embraces uncertainty, amplifies diverse perspectives, and focuses on relationships and empathy, rather than services or products. Visit Library Island to learn more about this approach and how to apply it in playful, pragmatic ways across your service.
      Attendees will:


      Become familiar with the Information Experience approach and its application in digital & physical library offerings, including using IX to address the culture of fake news


      Learn to use and adapt fast, practical, cost-effective approaches to solicit and develop plans, visions, and missions which can be embraced by staff and stakeholders alike


      Be able to develop their own open-ended roleplay sessions, suited to their own institutions & communities 


      About our facilitatorMatt Finch (matthewfinch.me) works with communities, companies, and institutions to help them do useful and surprising new things. Currently serving as a Creative/Researcher for the British Library, Matt has devised everything from spooky time-travel games in Ann Arbor, USA to a season of burlesque in New Zealand’s biggest city and live zombie battles in rural Australia. He is also co-author of the new strategic vision for the future of public libraries in Queensland, Australia, and a strategic consultant to universities & healthcare providers.
      Fees$40 for METRO members / $80 for non-members
      ScholarshipsFull scholarships are available for this event. Please apply here by February 15.
      Testimonials“Matt’s “Battle for Library Island” roleplaying event opened many minds to the challenges and tensions of library service, allowing both brand-new personnel from the finance department, and old public service hands who thought they fully understood their work, to rapidly see things they do every day from a totally different perspective. Library Island is a brilliantly fun and simple simulation of an entire community that is as fun and engaging as it is insightful and thought-provoking.” – Eli Neiburger, Deputy Director, Ann Arbor District Library, USA
      “Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. Matt’s ability to adapt his presentation and activities to make it relevant and to cater for the needs of his audience is commendable. His twist on the “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s mind to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. The workshop was attended by clinical and non-clinical staff from executive level management to admin support staff and was deemed extremely successful by all staff members who attended the workshop.” – Javed Khan, Engagement Coordinator (Planning, Engagement, and Reform) – Metro South Health Board, Queensland, Australia

    text: |-
      Registration Open: ISLE & Islandora Hack/Doc, March 12-13 in NYC
      THIS IS NOT SOLD OUT! Registration is open for an Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)-themed hack/doc, March 12-13 at METRO. Attendance is free and space is limited (note that we are currently asking that no more than two people from any single institution register at the moment). Registration will be open until March 5th. Feel free to contact Martha, mtenney@barnard.edu with any questions.
      Register HERE.
      What is ISLE?
      Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) is a new project in development that will address two of the most significant pain-points in Islandora--installation and maintenance--using Docker containers. ISLE is supported by a variety of (mostly small) institutions who have Islandora installations. For more information, click here.  
      What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
      A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon--bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time--with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
      What will we be doing?
      Plans for the hack/doc are still being formed, but on one of the days you can expect to be introduced to Docker and use ISLE to spin up a full Islandora 7x stack (documentation and friendly ISLE teachers included). Other activities may include improving ISLE testing and documentation; creating workflows for the maintenance of ISLE installations; and discussions about migration, future phases of the ISLE project, coordinating ISLE with Islandora CLAW, and a planned "liberal arts sprint" to develop more robust institutional repository features in Islandora. Finally, you can expect to meet folks, build networks, and personally help to make ISLE more responsive and useful for the Islandora community.
      What about the venue/food/travel/etc.?
      We will follow up with schedules, any do-ahead work, and any other necessary information for registered attendees. For more logistics information, please follow this space: https://goo.gl/mdsyyo.

      Photography & Photoshop Essentials, Part 1:Essential Lighting Techniques for 3D Objects and Flat Art
      We are putting more and more of our cultural heritage objects online as digital images. Learn how to photograph 2- and 3- dimensional objects in a way that captures and enhances the detail and beauty of the originals. In this session we will cover techniques that you can apply to online exhibits, promotional materials, or digitization work.
      The first in a series of three workshops centered on photography and photoshop, this session will give participants an introductory understanding of essential lighting techniques for 3D objects and flat art. Topics covered will include:


      Understanding light


      Types of light sources


      Direct light vs. diffused light


      Lighting techniques for three-dimensional objects


      Lighting techniques for two-dimensional objects and flat art


      No prerequisite knowledge or experience is required for this session. Students are encouraged to bring their own cameras in order to participate in hands-on exercises throughout the workshop.

      How to Take the Lead: Leveraging your role as a problem-solver in your institution
      The facilitators of this session will use their own experiences to help participants fill the role of “internal consultants,” employees who “influence [their institutions] through credibility, expertise, skills, knowledge and understanding and to change something.” The workshop will offer practical methods of:· Filling the role of an internal consultant· Explaining your value to committees that solve problems and take advantage of opportunities· Identifying, understanding, and solving the institutions' problems and opportunities to help the institution realize their full potential· Helping find solutions by, for example, searching the literature and facilitating brainstorming sessions with other employeesThis session will consist of an hour-long interactive talk by Sheryl Ramer and Deborah Goss, who have begun to view themselves as internal consultants, followed by several short presentations by librarians who have helped institutions to solve problems.
      Abour Our Instructors

      Teaching Research Data Management and Reproducibility: Ways to Engage Your Community in Research Stewardship

      By understanding researchers' workflows, teaching data management is that much more efficient. In this session, Vicky Steeves (Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, New York University) will give an introduction to those looking to start offering services around research data management and reproducibility.
      Steeves will introduce the concepts, terminology, and best practices of data management and reproducibility from both the perspective of librarians and researchers. Steeves will also demonstrate existing open-source infrastructure and workflows that enable best practices in data management and working more with more reproducibility. Participants will experiment with online tools, engage in discussions, and work on small group activities. Folks walking away from this workshop will have a better idea of how to engage with researchers on these topics, offer more research services, and foster a community of stewardship within their institutions.

      Learning objectives:

      Participants will gain an understanding of some basic concepts in data management and reproducibility
      Participants will know about available tools that help work towards research reproducibility
      Participants will understand how to offer and scale services around data management and reproducibility
      Participants will be able to, at the very least, know what to look up when Googling


      This is an introductory workshop; no prerequisite knowledge or experience is required.

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)

      Intro to Code: Javascript, data, and poetry
      This workshop is a beginner-friendly introduction to coding as a hands-on, sketch-driven exploration of basic computer concepts. We'll use Javascript to learn how to create data types and program control flow (i.e., loops, if statements), how data enters and exits a computer, and to build a basic understanding of computing concepts. Awareness of the shifting boundary between human and computer language teaches us how computers excel and how we can shape the flexible parts of our ideas to make our lives easier. The workshop will culminate with writing our own Markov chains and poetry zines generated from literary texts from Project Gutenberg.

      Students will learn the basic vocabulary of computer code, basic javascript, how to make an interactive HTML page, and how to parse and store data that comes in from the internet.

      This workshop is for students who have experience with computers like using a keyboard and navigating your way around folders. However, no coding experience is required.

      Topics covered will include:


      What is code? Human and computer languages


      Peeking inside of files - the rich text file format


      HTML and CSS in under 5 minutes


      3 things computers can do in a program: storage, algebra/compare, and control flow


      Interactive javascript applications inside of HTML files



      Text games


      Drawing with the mouse



      Fetching data from the internet with JQuery


      Generative content with Markov chains



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Windows, Mac, or Linux are all good. Chromebooks won't work as local file storage is required.Please have the following two programs pre-loaded:



      Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/


      Chrome Browser: https://www.google.com/chrome/




      About our instructor:
      Robby Kraft is an creative engineer and instructor at Parsons School of Design and the School for Poetic Computation. He codes creative interactive visualization tools and installations and works on new origami designs and the mathematics of folding.
