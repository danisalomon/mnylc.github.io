      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny. 
      Participants will:

      explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets.  

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

    text: |-
      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using Python, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use Python to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install Python and supporting software
      Learn basic commands for exploring data
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data 

      No previous programming experience required!
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.
