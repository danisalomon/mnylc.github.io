      Join us in this interactive workshop as we practice communication skills to promote gender equity and empathy in your workplace. We will engage in a series of team-building exercises and discussions focused on sharing experiences, building confidence, and deconstructing the systems that perpetuate inequities in our field. The exercises will consist of one-on-one and group conversations, games, and scenario-testing improvisation. 
      At the end of the workshop, participants will have the tools to:

      Recognize structures of gender inequity in the workplace
      Communicate their value to coworkers, supervisors, and patrons
      Practice empathy and flexibility in everyday conversations


      About our instructors:

You can find her recently published article, "To Uphold and Resist: Protecting Intellectual Freedom through Progressive Librarianship," in The Serials Librarian. During the day, she manages information at a non-profit organization.
      Peter Rossetti is a life design strategist and graphic designer who helps people uncover their vision and goals. Peter is focused on creating opportunities for experiential learning and facilitates workshops on how design and creativity can improve lives. He is the President of AIGA Brand Central, a professional design organization that serves the branding community in the NYC Metro area.

  description:
    text: |-
      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny. 
      Participants will:

      explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets.  

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

  description:
    text: |-
      Please join us to hear from Ilona Kish, program director of Reading & Writing Foundation (located in Brussels, Belgium). She'll discuss what it takes to build effective Europe-wide advocacy initiatives and legislative support for libraries, including a debrief on what elements work (and do not work!) for their initiative.
      In this talk, Ilona will demonstrate some of the material collected during a tour of 15 countries and libraries and will cover basic EU policies as a point of comparison with the ways in which the U.S. operates.
      Reading & Writing Foundation has built a network of legislators that support the work of Public Libraries across the EU. The foundation has created effective messaging that can be used across the 65,000 Public Libraries in 28 different member’s states, with almost as many languages between them. This year, Reading & Writing Foundation worked to coordinate advocacy on copyright during a legislative review.

This year, Reading &amp; Writing Foundation worked to coordinate advocacy on copyright during a legislative review.</P>

      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using R, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use R to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install R and RStudio
      Navigate the RStudio interface 
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data. 

      No previous programming experience required! 
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.
