    text: "A stable, sustainable, and attractive website is key for libraries, archives
      and other public organizations to stay connected to their communities. Up-to-date
      content like public programming details, photo galleries and blogs outwardly
      reflect the interior vibrancy of information/cultural heritage orgs.\nThe barriers
      to creating and updating an active website have been drastically lowered in
      recent years thanks to static site generation software and low-risk options
      for web hosting. This workshop will cover how to use a popular combination for
      building low-maintenance websites: Jekyll, a blog/content-generating software
      for creating easy HTML page templates, and GitHub Pages, a free hosting platform.\nBy
      the end of this two-hour workshop, attendees will:\n\n\nBe able to identify
      the difference between dynamic and static websites, and the particular benefits
      of static sites\n\n\nPublish a basic, live Jekyll website hosted on GitHub Pages\n\n\nLearn
      how to update that site with their own content via the GitHub web editor or
      a local text editor\n\n\nPrerequisite knowledge/experience:\n\n\nSome familiarity
      with git and/or GitHub (strongly encouraged)\n\n\nWhat to bring:\n\n\nA Mac
      or Windows laptop with GitHub Desktop and a “text editor” of user’s choice previously
      installed. E.g. for Mac: Atom, Sublime Text, BBEdit, TextMate; for Windows:
