      Project Management. 

      Those words can carry an intimidating aura of official methodologies and tools you’re ‘supposed’ to use, words like Agile, Kanban, Jira, gantt charts. However, successful project management is often simpler than these terms would imply. It all boils down to good communication and information management - practices librarians are especially skilled at. 


      In this workshop, we’ll peel back the jargon around project management to get back to these first principles of communication and information management, and how they are expressed in good project management artifacts, routines, and tools. We’ll also work through case study exercises together.

      By understanding what is fundementally important to project management, you’ll be able to adapt your style and assess the right tools for different situations as the context demands, because projects and project management approaches aren’t one-size fits all.

      After this session, participants will:

      Have an understanding that project management requires good communication and information management
      Know how to assess the right tools for their project
      Know how to produce good written artifacts like meeting notes, project charters, and plans + practice good habits

      About our instructor:
      Ara Kim has spent her career pursuing interests in linguistics, culture, technology, and organizational behavior and has held a number of leadership positions at the intersection of these subjects. She is a co-founder of Related Works, a sustainable business building well-designed tools for cultural institutions to manage their digital materials, and consults on operational process at places like Data and Society and The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Previously, she held various product and project management positions at NYPL Labs, Google, and Etsy.

      Loan Meetup (formerly the METRO ILL SIG!)</p> <p>We''ll have an open forum for
      interlibrary loan librarians and other parties interested in posing interlibrary
      loan related questions or sharing their latest ideas and resources. Please send
      us any agenda items you’d like to discuss.</p> <p>The event will be held at:</p>
      <p>The new METRO Training Center (8th floor)</p> <p>599 Eleventh Avenue (between
      44th Street and 45th Street)</p> <p>Please note, the METRO Interlibrary Loan
      SIG and the METRO Circulation and Reserves SIG are combining to become the Library
      Resource Sharing: Circulation, Interlibrary Loan and Reserves MeetUp group.
      In this way, new groups can be accommodated by METRO, and you will get more
      information about our shared interests through a shared MeetUp page and emails.
      We will also make it clear to everyone which meetings are focused on Interlibrary
      Loan and which are focused on Circulation and Reserves so that you can attend
      either one (or both, if you like!). This meeting will be focused on Interlibrary
      Loan, but everyone is welcome.</p> <p>If you are in the ILL MeetUp you will
      see a change in our title. If you are in the Circulation and Reserves group
      you will need to sign up for the Library Resource Sharing: Circulation, Interlibrary

  description:
    text: |
      It’s in your browser. Your operating system. Your phone. Your car. Your automated home assistant. And of course, it’s on your institution's public website. Search is everywhere. But most users, and even most administrators or engineers, know very little about what happens behind the scenes when you type something into that proverbial textbox. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive to understand how Search works from the ground up. We’ll cover classic information retrieval subjects like:


      Inverted Index


      Analysis


      Tokenization


      Character Normalization


      Stemming / Lemmatization


      Stopwords


      Synonyms


      Ranking


      TFIDF/BM25


      We’ll also briefly talk about the components that make modern search engines like Google orders of magnitude more intelligent and resilient than these classic technique

      About our instructor:
      Gio has been working with data, architecting systems, and leading teams of engineers for over a decade. He’s currently a co-founder at Related Works (www.relatedworks.io), which aims to build simple, intelligent products that help cultural institutions share their collections with the world. Previously he worked as a Staff Engineer at Etsy, where he lead the Search Ranking and Search Experience teams.

    html: The Universal Elements of Good Design
  description:
    text: "Everything in our lives was designed by someone, from the alarm that wakes
      us up in the morning to the book we read before going to bed. Across the myriad
      of objects, tools, and apps that we use every day, they were designed using
      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and
      sound. \nIn this three-hour workshop, we’re going to break up our time into
      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and
      review a variety of real world print and interactive examples to discuss how
      they impact the final design. Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
      and put them into practice together.\nNo previous design experience required
      to participate. This workshop is great for those that have an interest in design
      but have had little to no previous training.\nBy the end of this workshop, participants
      will have:\n\n\nAn understanding of the fundamental building blocks every designer
      uses in their work to create effective and compelling visual designs\n\n\nHow
      to use these fundamental building blocks to design for print and screen\n\n\nHands-on
      practice establishing designing and leveraging space, typography, color, and
      motion, and sound to create a unique visual language\n\n\n\nAbout our Instructor:Magera
      Holton, Co-founder at Related Works believes the best design is the one you’re
      least likely to notice. She most recently managed the Design Systems Team at
      Etsy, responsible for building core UX components and design guidelines utilized
      by product teams every day across the organization. She managed Buyer Experience,
      which focused on streamlining the purchasing experience and bringing Etsy’s
      unique content to the forefront. \nAs an individual contributor at Etsy, she
      patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows:
      checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at
      Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling
      the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not
      thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over
      renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.\n"
