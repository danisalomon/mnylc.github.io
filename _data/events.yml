      and, especially, each other. The past year has seen a surge of library union
      activism, from a CUNY contract that got big wins for library faculty to the
      stand against the lockout at LIU Brooklyn. We invite you to join other library
      union activists in jump-starting solidarity connections across the city. Organizers
      from CUNY and LIU Brooklyn will lead a planning discussion for steps we can
      take to strengthen worker organizing in city libraries. Academic, special, school,
      and public librarians are all welcome.</p> <p>This meeting will be facilitated
      by Emily Drabinski and Jonathan Cope.</p> "

    html: "<p><b>Spring Reference SIG Meeting &amp; Call for Submissions:<br/>Urgent
      Reference in Trumps America<br/>Wednesday, May 10th, 2017; 10am - 12pm</b></p>
      <p>We welcome submissions for Lightning Round presentations on the theme of
      Urgent Reference in a post-Trump climate.</p> <p>Students and patrons are approaching
      the reference desk at a time abuzz with questions of misinformation &amp; disinformation
      &amp; accusations of “fake news” &amp; “alternative facts.” Providing reference
      has become differently urgent as the stakes for a Critical Information Literacy
      -  for an informed citizenry at a time when the very definitions of “information”
      and “literacy” are called into question - are suddenly, jarringly high.</p>
      <p>This spring the METRO Reference SIG will focus on Reference Work in this
      new climate. We believe that Reference Librarianship, in particular, is now,
      and has always been an avenue for “care work.”  We seek to create a climate
      to come together and discuss our practice, showcase tools for research, interrogate
      systemic and evolving needs and to brainstorm and support one another in finding
      solutions.</p> <p><b>Urgent Reference as it relates to:</b></p> <p>• News related
      to the Trump administration in general</p> <p>• Healthcare/Affordable Care Act </p>
      <p>• Issues on Immigration Legislation </p> <p>• Executive Orders and governmental
      procedures </p> <p>• Working through “fake news” /”alternative” “facts” with
      students </p> <p>• Determining the best ways to supply students with tools for
      informed responses, etc.</p> <p><b>We consider Urgent Reference to mean reference
      work that directly:</b></p> <p>• Seeks to uncover current events </p> <p>• Sources
      news and various forms of media </p> <p>• Can differentiate between Right and
      Left politics </p> <p>• Provides support to vulnerable communities </p> <p>• Provides
      support to activist communities </p> <p>• Provides Critical Data Literacy </p>
      <p>• Has a hand on the pulse of controversy</p> <p>Presentations should be 10
      minutes each.  A group discussion will follow the presentations. Send one paragraph
      descriptions of your presentation, detailing topics covered and if you will
      have slides to kadler@mcny.edu &amp; ssmith4@gc.cuny.edu by April 30th 2016.<br/>Confirmations
      will arrive by May 5th, 2017. </p> "
