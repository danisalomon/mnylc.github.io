      Safeguarding and Activating Digital Video Information in Cultural Institutions
      In cultural organizations, internally-produced digital video materials often function both as vital information resources and as conduits for public engagement. As key components of institutional memory, these assets undoubtedly deserve to be safeguarded for future access. But implementing effective storage and access infrastructures for digital media can prove challenging, especially for organizations equipped with limited funding and staff.
      Co-organized by the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) and the National Digital Stewardship Residency for Art Information (NDSR Art), this panel will bring together specialists from a diverse range of institutional contexts to share their experiences preserving and activating digital video.
      NDSR Art is a partnership of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and ARLIS/NA, made possible with generous funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) via a 2016 Laura Bush 21st-Century Librarian Program grant.
      Panelists:
      Amye McCarther, Archivist and Media Conservator; New Museum
      Dave Rice, Archivist; CUNY Television
      Ben Fino-Radin, Founder and Lead Conservator; Small Data Industries
      Farris Wahbeh, Benjamin and Irma Weiss Director of Research Resources; Whitney Museum of American Art
      Panel Moderator:
      Jean Moylan, 2018-19 National Digital Stewardship Residency for Art Information fellow; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

      Reception to follow:
      6:00-7:00 p.m.
      The Landmark Tavern
      626 11th Avenue
      New York, NY 10036

    text: "We all know that workshops and one-shots have varying degrees of success
      meeting students’ information literacy needs. Attendance, student engagement,
      and faculty buy-in are all impediments to success. What if you could turn your
      ideas into a multi-session course, giving you control of the curriculum and
      learning outcomes? During this day-long workshop intended for academic librarians,
      participants will take a topic they are interested in and turn it into a multi-session
      course. In the morning we will focus on course development, including determining
      learning outcomes and scaffolding assignments. In the afternoon we will focus
      on pedagogy, including creating lesson plans and leading a class session. We
      will also brainstorm ways to adapt this model to individual environments (based
      on needs, resources, staffing strengths/limitations, etc.). This workshop is
      hands-on. Participants are asked to come with an idea for a class in mind (for
      example: What is something you are interested in teaching more in-depth? What
      is a skill faculty say students are lacking? What topic would add to your school's
      curriculum?), as well as an internet-enabled device for independent and group
      work (laptop, tablet, etc.). Participants will come away with a rough syllabus
      for a multi-session course, a few lesson plans/assignments geared towards their
      topic, and an understanding of how to facilitate class sessions. \n\nWhat to
      bring:\n\n\nA laptop or other internet-enabled device\n\n\n\nOr click here to
      borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00\n\n\n\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKellyAnne
      McGuire is the Outreach Librarian at the Alumni Library at Bard College at Simon’s
      Rock in Great Barrington, MA. She has worked and volunteered at public, high
      school, and academic libraries in NY and MA. She has taught classes at the high
      school and undergraduate level both in-person and online, as well as numerous
      workshops for patrons of all ages. Most recently, she helped develop an information
      studies curriculum at Simon’s Rock consisting of ten, one-credit, half-semester
      (seven week) courses taught by librarians that provide opportunities for students
      to develop metaliteracy and resilience within academia and beyond. KellyAnne
      has a BA from Mount Holyoke College, and a MSLIS from the University of Illinois
      at Urbana-Champaign. \n\n"
