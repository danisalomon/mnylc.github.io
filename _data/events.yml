      Libraries have long been concerned with protecting the privacy of users from prying eyes, but the internet is changing much of that. Job sites, online retailers, and a myriad other outlets collect sensitive data from our patrons. A reversal of privacy protections coming from the federal government means that ISPs can sell our data to the highest bidder. Simply put, our right to privacy is under threat.
      What can libraries do to continue to protect our users’ sensitive data? How can we ensure that our users’ data stays safe? Are Tor relays a viable option?
      In 2015, Library Freedom Project and Lebanon Libraries set up a Tor relay to address these issues. Join us for a talk with Chuck McAndrew to find out how Tor works, how to get your community on board, and what your library can do to support global internet freedom.
