      Data Dictionaries for NYC Open Data!\nWe’re unveiling a new user-friendly approach
      for NYC Open Data’s data dictionaries.  Explore popular datasets from the Taxi
      & Limousine Commission, Department of City Planning, 311, and other agencies,
      and see how new metadata standards make it easier to find and use the data you’re
      looking for.\nIf you’re an information professional, librarian, data manager,

      project, networking, and a discussion of where we can go next. \n\nAbout the
      Metadata for All Project\nFor the past six months, a team of data librarians
      has been working with the Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics (MODA), and the broader
      NYC Open Data Team, to find ways to make the metadata of the top 100 most-used
      datasets on NYC Open Data more usable  and explore new ways to ensure that metadata
      is user-friendly for all New Yorkers. The Metadata for All project is made possible
      by a grant from the Sloan Foundation and partnerships with the Mayor’s Fund
      to Advance New York City, METRO, Mayor’s Office of Data Analytics, NYC Open
      Data Team, Pratt Institute, Brooklyn Public Library, Queens Public Library,
