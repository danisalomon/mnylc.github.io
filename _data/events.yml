      but has real world applications and life-long impact. Our workshop will strive

      its impact on learning, as well as in life. We won't just look at fake news,
      but how the media landscape is changing, and how to best prepare our students
      to use information effectively. \nAlia Methven and Cherie Yanek from Avenues:

    text: "We all know that workshops and one-shots have varying degrees of success
      meeting students’ information literacy needs. Attendance, student engagement,
      and faculty buy-in are all impediments to success. What if you could turn your
      ideas into a multi-session course, giving you control of the curriculum and
      learning outcomes? During this day-long workshop intended for academic librarians,
      participants will take a topic they are interested in and turn it into a multi-session
      course. In the morning we will focus on course development, including determining
      learning outcomes and scaffolding assignments. In the afternoon we will focus
      on pedagogy, including creating lesson plans and leading a class session. We
      will also brainstorm ways to adapt this model to individual environments (based
      on needs, resources, staffing strengths/limitations, etc.). This workshop is
      hands-on. Participants are asked to come with an idea for a class in mind (for
      example: What is something you are interested in teaching more in-depth? What
      is a skill faculty say students are lacking? What topic would add to your school's
      curriculum?), as well as an internet-enabled device for independent and group
      work (laptop, tablet, etc.). Participants will come away with a rough syllabus
      for a multi-session course, a few lesson plans/assignments geared towards their
      topic, and an understanding of how to facilitate class sessions. \n\nWhat to
