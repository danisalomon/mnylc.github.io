    text: "Join us at METRO for this three-part organizing workshop, taking place
      on:\n\nThursday, October 11th from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM;\nThursday, October 18th from
      11:00 AM - 2:00 PM; and\nThursday, October 25th from 11:00 AM - 2:00 PM\n\n\nIn
      this workshop, participants will learn concrete strategies for building skills,
      utilizing resources, and creating networks to challenge and reimagine structures
      of power. In three sessions, organizers from the Prison Library Support Network
      (PLSN) will lead attendees through the steps of organizing, from idea to action.\nAttendees
      will learn how to discern opportunities for connection, power building, and
      resistance within their communities, both personal and professional. They will
      receive an exercise workbook and resource guide to aid in their future organizing
      work and personal development.While it is not required to attend all three sessions,
      previous activities will frame future ones. If you know that you will miss a
      session, please let us know so we can provide you with the relevant exercises
      to complete to keep you up to speed. Attendees do not need to have any previous
      experience with organizing and are welcome (but not required) to bring personal
      laptops to work on. Session 1: Assessment, Planning & Research This session
      will cover the initial steps of developing an organizing practice through self-reflection,
      capacity/asset mapping, and research. We will analyze the social and economic
      context in which we work, exploring how our work interacts with broader structures
      of violence, white supremacy, colonialism, and our cultures. By the end of this
      session, participants will:\n\nDevelop a common definition of organizing and
      shared process for analyzing and responding to the needs of our community \nCultivate
      understanding of collective research strategies and analysis that can be used
      to develop a deeper understanding of the historical and current context of an
      issue and further identify allies, threats, and critical resources to support
      with organizing efforts\n\nSession 2: Collaboration & ActionIn this session,
      we will define effective strategies and multiple action tactics that create
      meaningful outcomes. We will also discuss internal organizational structures
      and practical connection building.By the end of this session, participants will:\n\nBuild
      awareness of strategies used by community organizations and activists who are
      organizing across intersections \nCarry out a process for assessing potential
      partnerships and organizing campaigns/actions\n\nSession 3: Evaluate and SustainThe
      final session will culminate in learning methods for effective maintenance of
      your organizations and projects through the process of designing relevant evaluation
      criteria and group reflection.By the end of this session, participants will:\n\nUnderstand
      how to structure and manage an organization through consensus building and positive
      meeting facilitation\nEvaluate themselves and their organization's progress\nRecognize
      and learn strategies to overcome burnout\n\nAbout PLSNThe Prison Library Support
      Network is an information-based collective that aims to redistribute resources
      and provide support to incarcerated people. Our work is rooted in our recognition
      of systematic violence that the prison industrial complex creates. We believe
      that information is a tool for prison abolition, and that we must create space
      for people who want to commit and redistribute their own capacities and resources.\n\nAbout
      our instructors:\nMia Bruner’s work seeks to activate archival and library collections
      as sites of public dialogue, collective power, and resistance. Right now, she
      works as a Librarian at Pratt Institute Libraries, organizes with PLSN, and
      is building a radical queer subject thesaurus at the Lesbian Herstory Archives.
      Emma Karin Eriksson’s personal and professional ideology is one of intersectionality,
      respect, and DIY. She is currently receiving her MLIS with a focus in critical
      instruction, library outreach, and community support. \n"

  description:
    text: "The recipe for successful public programming at a library is complex. It
      is a mixture of knowing your community, keeping track of trends, advance planning,
      marketing, project management, and persistence. The devil is truly in the details.\nPublic
      programming allows library staff to bring a variety of opportunities for learning,
      engaging, entertaining, and building connections across all age groups to the
      communities we serve. Programming has seen tremendous growth in the last decade
      in terms scope and variety and has become a core service to the mission of libraries.
      Planning and running programs is no longer something extra to be done in spare
      time. Like any other core service, it requires careful planning, tracking and
      evaluation.\nThis practical workshop will examine current trends in programming
      for adult audiences at public libraries and also explore a variety of project
      management techniques that can be used to ensure that all goes smoothly during
      every phase of planning.\nThis workshop will demonstrate and examine the following
      topics:\n\n\nMethods for evaluating current programs and key steps to creating
      a long range programming plan\n\n\nProject management forms that allow for organization
      and tracking of multiple programs\n\n\nAssessment tools that allow for collection
      of both qualitative and quantitative data about programs\n\n\nCurrent trends
      in programming for adult audiences at public libraries\n\n\nNo previous experience
      or knowledge is required.\n\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper\n\n\n\nAbout
      our instructor:\nJanie Hermann, in her role as Public Programming Librarian
      at the Princeton Public Library, oversees the more than 2,000 public programs
      put together by the amazing team she is privileged to work with. Her work at
      the library allows her to interact with a wide variety of local groups and organizations
      and she is dedicated to ensuring the public programs offered at the library
      not only meet but exceed the expectations of the Princeton community. She was
      named an LJ Mover and Shaker in 2007, has served on the NJ State Library’s Blue
      Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Libraries and is involved in many capacities
      with ALA, most notably as chair of the Programming Librarian Interest Group.
      As a teacher, librarian, wife and mother, Janie has learned that minute details
      can have a big impact and that planning is crucial, but you still have to leave
      room for some spontaneous actions.\n\n"

      Every hospital has problems to solve and opportunities to take advantage of. They need to improve patient care and satisfaction and prepare for surveys by The Joint Commission and other accrediting bodies. Nurses need to pass required courses and study for certifications and doctors need to pass their boards. Employees need to be engaged to improve recruitment and retention. As information professionals in hospitals and healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to identify issues and find ways to be pro-active in addressing them. In this session, we will explore potential information gaps and hear from vendors who sell relevant products that may be unfamiliar to many librarians.
      Speakers:


      Dawn BonsorIsabel, a differential diagnosis tool


      Michael MaiselOncourse Learning/CE Direct, an online continuing education platform for healthcare professionals 


      Martha TeuRosetta Stone, an online language learning tool

    text: "Building Solidarity: Supporting Community Organizations through Archival
      Practice\nFor the past several decades, community archives such as the Lesbian
      Herstory Archives, Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project, and the Freedom
      Archives have been important sites of self-determination, memory, and inspiration
      for historically disenfranchised communities. In recent years, archivists and
      information workers have become increasingly interested in using their professional
      skills to support these projects. This workshop will discuss what community
      archives are and why they are important. We will review key scholars, discuss
      ethical considerations, and explore the effects of privilege in this work. Key
      tools and techniques, such as records management, DIY digitization stations,
      and non-hierarchical practice will be examined. In the afternoon, we will partner
      with local NYC organization Asian American Arts Alliance to create a thoughtful
      plan for the long-term stewardship of their records. Participants will leave
      the workshop with a theoretical grounding in the current activist and professional
      conversations around community archives, knowledge about how LIS professionals
      can support this work, suggestions for practical tools, and experience putting
      these tools into practice.\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper or personal
      laptop for notetaking\n\n\n\nAbout our instructors:\nAnjali Goyal is an arts
      administrator and has worked with various community-based arts nonprofits for
      the past 15 years. She is currently the Development Manager at the Asian American
      Arts Alliance in Brooklyn, NY. Marie Lascu is a graduate of NYU's Moving Image
      Archiving and Preservation program. She has been a member of the XFR Collective
      since 2015, and works as the audiovisual archivist for Crowing Rooster Arts,
      a media non-profit that has spent more than 20 years documenting the arts and
      political struggles of Haiti. Maggie Schreiner is an archivist at the Brooklyn
      Historical Society, and has been a volunteer with Interference Archive and Librarians
      and Archivists with Palestine since 2013. She is a graduate of NYU's Archives
