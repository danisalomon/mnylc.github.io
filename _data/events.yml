      Matroska is a flexible audiovisual container currently undergoing standardization work within the Internet Engineering Task Force for preservation use. This workshop will review the architecture of Matroska and demonstrate many features relevant to archival work, such as:



      Utilizing Matroska’s checksum features
      Metadata management
      Description of technical characteristics
      Attachment management (logs, supporting documentation, related imagery, decoders)
      Presentational control & ordered editions
      Validation and best practices



      Participants will work with tools such as ffmpeg, mkvalidator, mkvpropedit, mediaconch, and mkclean.
      By the end of this workshop, particpants will be able to utilize Matroska for their audiovisual preservation projects.
      We recommend participants bring their own laptops (Macs preferred) for this workshop.

    text: |-
      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny. 
      Participants will:

      explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets.  

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

      Join us for an interactive workshop on combating “fake news” and promoting media literacy in the “post-truth” era. We will discuss our experiences leading an information literacy teach-in titled “Don’t Take the Clickbait: Practical Ways to Recognize and Fight Fake News” at Purchase College, SUNY. We will also invite participants to share their experiences and brainstorm ways to engage patrons from a variety of backgrounds and political orientations. This workshop aims to offer solutions for fighting the spread of “fake news,” rather than merely identifying the problem.
       At the end of this workshop, participants will have the tools to:

      Use hands-on activities to promote critical thinking about news sources
      Help and encourage library patrons to fight the spread of fake news and misinformation
      View  “fake news” programming through the lens of critical literacy and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy

      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using R, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use R to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install R and RStudio
      Navigate the RStudio interface 
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data. 

      No previous programming experience required! 
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.
