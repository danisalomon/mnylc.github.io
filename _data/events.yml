      Loan Meetup</p> <p>We'll have an open forum for interlibrary loan librarians
      and other parties interested in posing interlibrary loan related questions or
      sharing their latest ideas and resources. Please send us any agenda items you’d
      like to discuss.</p> <p>The event will be held at:</p> <p>The new METRO Training
      Center (8th floor)</p> <p>599 Eleventh Avenue (between 44th Street and 45th
      Street)</p> <p>Please note, the METRO Interlibrary Loan SIG and the METRO Circulation
      and Reserves SIG have combined to become the Library Resource Sharing: Circulation,
      Interlibrary Loan and Reserves MeetUp group. In this way, new groups can be
      accommodated by METRO, and you will get more information about our shared interests
      through a shared MeetUp page and emails. We will also make it clear to everyone
      which meetings are focused on Interlibrary Loan and which are focused on Circulation
      and Reserves so that you can attend either one (or both, if you like!). This
      meeting will be focused on Interlibrary Loan, but everyone is welcome.</p> <p>Hope
      to see you there!</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Emma Raub &amp; Beth Posner</p> "

    html: '<p>For the Spring 2018 research forum, the program will include:</p> <p>1.
      Jessica Koos, Jamie Saragossi, and Gregg Stevens (Stony Brook University) “What
      the Health: Teaching Free NLM Health Resources to Public Librarians”<br/>The
      main purpose of this project was to train public librarians and library school
      students on how to use several National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases,
      including MedlinePlus, Genetics Home Reference and TOXNET. The training consisted
      of three individual sessions, each one being conducted by a Stony Brook Health
      Sciences Librarian. In addition to the workshops that were provided, tutorials
      were created in order to provide further educational support and were made freely
      available online.</p> <p>2. Clara Tran, Carrie-Ann Miller, Doreen Aveni (Stony
      Brook University)<br/>“Baseline assessment: Understanding WISE freshman students’
      information literacy skills in a one-shot library session”<br/>To understand
      Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) freshman students’ information literacy
      skills, the authors surveyed students with a pre- and post-test in a one-shot
      library session held in the fall of 2016 at Stony Brook University. WISE Honors
      is a unique small program that 75 students were accepted into the fall 2016
      semester. Although our survey tests did not show a significant difference in
      knowledge learned, they provided valuable insight into how much information
      students can obtain from a one-shot library session. The authors also discussed
      findings and identified areas in this one-shot library session that can be improved.</p>
      <p>3. Claudia McGivney, Robert Tolliver, and Clara Tran (Stony Brook University)<br/>"Open
      Data for STEM Research"<br/>A wide variety of open data is available for STEM
      research, including government sources, discipline specific repositories, and
      institutional repositories. In this presentation we will talk about some of
      these resources, methods of finding open data, and ways STEM librarians can
      support their faculty and students with open data.</p> '

      Intro to Code: Javascript, data, and poetry
      This workshop is a beginner-friendly introduction to coding as a hands-on, sketch-driven exploration of basic computer concepts. We'll use Javascript to learn how to create data types and program control flow (i.e., loops, if statements), how data enters and exits a computer, and to build a basic understanding of computing concepts. Awareness of the shifting boundary between human and computer language teaches us how computers excel and how we can shape the flexible parts of our ideas to make our lives easier. The workshop will culminate with writing our own Markov chains and poetry zines generated from literary texts from Project Gutenberg.

      Students will learn the basic vocabulary of computer code, basic javascript, how to make an interactive HTML page, and how to parse and store data that comes in from the internet.

      This workshop is for students who have experience with computers like using a keyboard and navigating your way around folders. However, no coding experience is required.

      Topics covered will include:


      What is code? Human and computer languages


      Peeking inside of files - the rich text file format


      HTML and CSS in under 5 minutes


      3 things computers can do in a program: storage, algebra/compare, and control flow


      Interactive javascript applications inside of HTML files



      Text games


      Drawing with the mouse



      Fetching data from the internet with JQuery


      Generative content with Markov chains



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Windows, Mac, or Linux are all good. Chromebooks won't work as local file storage is required.Please have the following two programs pre-loaded:



      Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/


      Chrome Browser: https://www.google.com/chrome/

      Applying Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Manuscripts)
      This workshop will provide an introduction to DCRM(MSS): Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Manuscripts), the new standard for cataloging individual manuscripts recently approved by RBMS (the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section of ACRL). The workshop will include a brief introduction to the manual's guiding principles, discussion of how manuscript cataloging differs from the cataloging of published materials, introduction to the treatment of major elements of the catalog record in DCRM(MSS) (such as the title, place of production and date, and extent), and hands-on practice in applying DCRM(MSS).
      Attendees will acquire an understanding of the considerations involved in cataloging individual manuscripts, and will gain practice in applying DCRM(MSS) to the cataloging of different types of manuscripts commonly found in special collections using provided examples.
      Participants should have experience in MARC cataloging using AACR2.Familiarity with DCRM(B) and/or DACS will be helpful.

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00)
      A pencil and paper for note taking

      Understanding Data on the Web:data traces, Tor browser, and SecureDrop

      In this workshop, we'll talk about some of the physical parts of the internet and how they fit together. We'll look at our own data traces to see what snoopers and our ISPs can see when they look at our web traffic. We'll spend the last section of the workshop talking about how the Tor browser hides some of the data traces that would otherwise visible. We'll also cover a few specific uses of the Tor browser, including submitting documents securely and anonymously to newsrooms via SecureDrop.
      During this workshop, we'll:
      - Use cards with pictures of different pieces of internet infrastructure (router, ISP, etc.) to lay out how the internet works.- Download a few applications that let us dive deeper into how information travels across the internet:


      A packet sniffing application called Herbivore (if you don't know what "packet sniffing" is, don't worry! We'll talk about it in the workshop)


      The Tor browser


      - Walk through one specific use of the Tor browser: using it to submit documents securely and anonymously to news outlets and non-profits

      Learning outcomes include:


      Participants know how the basic building blocks of the internet—including routers, ISPs, servers, and data packets—fit together


      Participants have an understanding of the digital data traces we create when we use the internet


      Participants know how to use Tor and can decide when it makes sense to use based on the situation



      Prerequisite knowledge and/or experience:


      What’s assumed: Basic computer fluency, including how to browse the web and download free software from the internet.  


      We’ll learn together: Basics of internet infrastructure, like what role a router plays in getting a webpage to our computer; what a "data packet” is; what metadata is; what we mean when we talk about security and anonymity online.



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). Herbivore, which we’ll download and demo during the workshop, only works on Mac computers, but we’ll briefly discuss an alternative for Windows.All software options we’ll look at are free.


      About our instructor:Jen Kagan is a programmer, writer, and teacher. She's a recent graduate of NYU-ITP, where she's currently a research resident, and she's also a tech fellow at Coworker.org.

      Introduction to NYC Open Data
      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny.
      Participants will:

      Explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      Learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      Download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets


      What to bring:

      A laptop with access to Google Sheets or Excel(or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00)



      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

    text: "Getting Started with Web Archives:A beginner's workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs
      our subjects, stakeholders, patrons, and donors increasingly engage each other
      and the world through online media, librarians and archivists are compelled
      to steward valuable born digital records into cohesive, preservable collections
      for future access and use. Web archiving--the process of collecting, preserving,
      and enabling access to web materials--presents a powerful opportunity for us
      to develop collections of these otherwise ephemeral resources. The most difficult
      step towards realizing this potential is often simply getting started; the daunting
      range of possible collecting scopes, policies, technologies, and workflows can
      stop a web archiving program before it starts. How does one define an achievable
      collecting mission, communicate their selection standards, and appropriate the
      necessary technical, human, and financial resources, without any practical experience
      in this emergent craft?Attendees to this workshop will overcome these obstacles
      with training and support from experts in the practice. The program will begin
      with a survey of web archiving that establishes a common level of understanding
      and language, progresses through case studies that represent the judgements
      and decisions to be made in designing a web archiving program, and conclude
      with a guided small-group exercise to design and make the first acquisitions
      into a model web archive.Specific learning objectives to this end include: understanding
      the nature and history of web archives as born digital collections; how to craft
      a mission-driven collection development policy for web archives; how to select
      among the available acquisition tools and descriptive standards to best support
      their patrons’ and stakeholders’ needs; and best practices for long-term preservation
      and access to these resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to bring:\n\n\nA laptop
      (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). \n\n\nAbout our
      instructors:Karl-Rainer Blumenthal helps organizations and individuals to build
      web archives through software support, training, testing, and documentation,
      as a web archivist for the Internet Archive’s Archive-It service. His boundless
      enthusiasm for all things web archiving developed during his term as a National
      Digital Stewardship Resident with the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC).
      He has served as the founding co-chair of the Art Libraries Society of North
      America’s Web Archiving Special Interest Group and chair of the Society of American
      Archivists’ Web Archiving Section. Select publications include “A collaborative
      model for web archiving ephemeral art resources at the New York Art Resources
      Consortium” (with Sumitra Duncan in Art Libraries Journal, 2016) and “Digital
      Preservation Metadata Practice for Web Archives” (with Clément Oury & Sébastien
      Peyrard in Digital Preservation Metadata for Practitioners, 2016). Karl earned
      his BA in History of Art from Haverford College and his MS in Library and Information
      Science from Drexel University.\n\nSamantha Abrams is Web Resources Collection
      Librarian at Ivy Plus Libraries, where she coordinates the partnership's Web
      Resources Collection Program. Now in its first year, the Program is a collaborative
      collection development effort to build curated, thematic collections of freely
      available, but at-risk, web content in order to support research at thirteen
      participating Ivy Plus Libraries and beyond. Before Ivy Plus Libraries, Samantha
      worked at StoryCorps, where she managed the organization's digital and physical
      assets, including born-digital audio and photos, physical paperwork, and electronic
      databases. Samantha has additional experience working in public libraries, publishing,
      and as a corporate archivist for the fast-casual restaurant chain Culver's.
      She is the current Social Media Coordinator for the Society of American Archivists'
      Web Archiving Section, and in 2014 she was awarded the Future Steward Award
      by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance, which recognizes emerging leaders
      taking a creative approach to advancing the knowledge of digital preservation
      issues and practices. Samantha earned her Bachelor's in English from the University
      of Iowa, and her Master's in Library and Information Studies from the University
      of Madison-Wisconsin.\n\n\n"

      (Mis)informed: Propaganda, Disinformation, Misinformation, and Our Culture
      Thursday, May 31, 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. & Friday, June 1, 10:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.
      Our culture is overwhelmed with instances of incorrect information in many forms. From foreign actors to our social connections, misleading and often dangerous information has seemingly co-opted our online and offline spaces.
      On Thursday, May 31 and Friday, June 1 METRO will host a symposium on the nature of falsified information. We’ll investigate the (social) media environment that allows incorrect information to thrive, seek a better understanding of the actors behind these events, and wax philosophical about the current state of counterfeit information and what this foreshadows about the library, archives, and museums community. And we’ll tease out concrete actions to take to better information our communities and ourselves.
      We’re now accepting presentation proposals for this symposium. Ideas for presentation topics include but are definitely not limited to:

      Counterfeit information in its various forms (propaganda, disinformation, misinformation, etc.)
      Historical perspectives on falsified news
      Explorations of how journalism is impacted by dis-intermediated information
      The role of emotion and attention in these issues
      The actors behind mal-information and what their goals might be
      The impact of falsified news on our communities
      Ideas for how we might play a role in clarifying these issues for our communities

      Please apply to present by midnight on Friday, April 13. Selected presenters will be notified on or by April 27.
      If you would like to be considered for a scholarship to this event, please complete this application by Friday, May 4, 2018. Recipients will be notified by Friday, May 11,  2018.

      PM\n\n\nThese three sessions will provide a broad understanding of the process,
      conceptualization, pre-production, production and post-production of filming
      a short story using a smartphone or DSLR camera with a do-it-yourself approach.\nParticipants
      will explore their own creativity, interests, and personal strengths in various
      technologies and their role in the production process. They will examine the
      underlying forms, principles and processes of filmmaking/photography as both
      makers and consumers, while designing a project in the areas of film, photography,
      sound, lighting and post-production using digital media. This course focuses
      on the basic use of a range of equipment and software as applied to practical
