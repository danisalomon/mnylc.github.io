      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny. 
      Participants will:

      explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets.  

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

      Join us for an interactive workshop on combating “fake news” and promoting media literacy in the “post-truth” era. We will discuss our experiences leading an information literacy teach-in titled “Don’t Take the Clickbait: Practical Ways to Recognize and Fight Fake News” at Purchase College, SUNY. We will also invite participants to share their experiences and brainstorm ways to engage patrons from a variety of backgrounds and political orientations. This workshop aims to offer solutions for fighting the spread of “fake news,” rather than merely identifying the problem.
       At the end of this workshop, participants will have the tools to:

      Use hands-on activities to promote critical thinking about news sources
      Help and encourage library patrons to fight the spread of fake news and misinformation
      View  “fake news” programming through the lens of critical literacy and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy

      Project managers at all levels are used to generating reports on the outcomes of funded projects. But how often do formatting requirements and content guidelines really highlight the most significant outcomes of our projects? And how often are we able to share and reuse the content we work so hard to generate in these reports? We find ourselves repeating the same information about our work in slightly different formats, only to see these reports filed away by funders, never to see the light of day.In this workshop, we will discuss outputs currently requested by funders, and review the ways in which these outputs match the outcomes of the project. We'll discuss how we can work to build more meaning into our (admittedly often dull) grant reports, how we might make them reusable, attractive portfolios of our work, and how we might learn from colleagues creating similar reports.Our facilitators will introduce participants to Global Grand Central, a social platform that "makes reporting fun, constructive, inspiring, long-term, connected, and social." The platform began in Europe and has reached the conclusion of a two-year design process driven by community practitioners. Now, the platform is expanding to a global audience and its developers are eager to hear from METRO members about gaps we perceive in the ways we’re now able to share methods and outcomes from our work with colleagues, funders, and the people we serve.By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

      Establish their own (free) hub profiles on Global Grand Central
      Create more engaging reports, built for public and professional audiences
      Share their feedback on the platform

      Participants are welcome to bring their own device or to borrow one of METRO's laptops.About our facilitators:Natalie Milbrodt leads Queens Library’s Metadata Services division. She is also a contributor to Global Grand Central. In 2010, Milbrodt developed the Queens Memory program to collect images and stories from residents for the library’s digital archives. Milbrodt graduated in 2000 from Michigan State University with a BA in Interdisciplinary Humanities and a Specialization in Film Studies. Before joining the library profession, she worked for film production, design and marketing firms in both creative and management roles.Marcus Haraldsson is the Project Leader for Global Grand Central. Based in Stockholm, Sweden, Haraldsson is a journalist and photographer with a background in peace and conflict research. His Bordr project was the subject of exhibitions in South Africa, Sweden, and the United States.

      A Linked Data Workflow with OpenRefine
      OpenRefine is a popular data wrangling tool among librarians and archivists. This workshop will cover the basics of data-cleaning and how to create interoperable linked data with OpenRefine.
      Topics covered include:

      Introduction to linked data;
      Data-cleaning with OpenRefine and Power Tools for Google Sheets;
      Using OpenRefine for name entity reconciliation, for example to VIAF, Wikidata, and Library of Congress identifiers;
      Discussion of metadata enrichment with linked open data.

      This workshop is designed to serve all levels of practitioners interested in adding linked data to their records or creating linked data. Participants will have an opportunity to complete a common reconciliation workflow, starting with the export of data from a MySQL database, cleaning the data, and finally reconciling data and importing the results.
      Laptops will be required for this class. Please bring your own, or sign up to borrow one of METRO's when you RSVP for this workshop.

      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using R, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use R to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install R and RStudio
      Navigate the RStudio interface 
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data. 

      No previous programming experience required! 
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

      In an era of unprecedented attacks on information workers, how can we mobilize to advocate for our own wages and working conditions? The facilitators will use their experience organizing during the faculty lockout at LIU Brooklyn in September 2016 to inform participatory activities that will help attendees understand the basics of union organizing in their own workplaces.The first half of the session will introduce the basics of getting to know your workplace. Union organizing relies on understanding who is in your unit, what their workplace needs and priorities are, and their level of engagement and commitment to union activity. Central to this process are lists of members that can be regularly updated and assessed as organizing and action proceeds. It is also critical to understand where members are in the organization so that connections between people can be made. Maps can be useful tools for this work. Attendees will leave with the beginnings of a list and map for further organizing.The second half of the session will focus on the organizing conversation. These are conversations where unit members come to understand shared concerns and begin to strategize for taking action. Attendees will gain hands on practice engaging the five steps of the organizing conversation.We expect attendees will leave the session with new tools to reinvigorate their engagement with workplace justice issues whether they are currently in a union or considering forming one.

    text: Intro to Data Analysis with Python
    html: Intro to Data Analysis with Python
  description:
    text: |-
      Participants will build on critical data literacy skills from previous workshops and begin to explore open data using Python, a free open source programming language used in various academic and professional fields. We’ll explore how patrons at academic, public, and high school libraries can use Python to aid their research, explore data sets and discover insights. 
      Participants will:

      Download and install Python and supporting software
      Learn basic commands for exploring data
      Explore a dataset from NYC Open Data 

      No previous programming experience required!
      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.
