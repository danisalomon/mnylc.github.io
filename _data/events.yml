      Registration Open: ISLE & Islandora Hack/Doc, March 12-13 in NYC
      THIS IS NOT SOLD OUT! Registration is open for an Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)-themed hack/doc, March 12-13 at METRO. Attendance is free and space is limited (note that we are currently asking that no more than two people from any single institution register at the moment). Registration will be open until March 5th. Feel free to contact Martha, mtenney@barnard.edu with any questions.
      Register HERE.
      What is ISLE?
      Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) is a new project in development that will address two of the most significant pain-points in Islandora--installation and maintenance--using Docker containers. ISLE is supported by a variety of (mostly small) institutions who have Islandora installations. For more information, click here.  
      What is a hack/doc and who should attend?
      A hack/doc combines the form of a hackathon--bringing coders together to work on a predetermined problem in a large block of time--with a substantial documentation and testing component. Attendees with a wide variety of skill sets will be welcomed and supported in hands-on work with ISLE. Anyone who works with installation or maintenance of Islandora (e.g. developers, DevOps folks), people from small institutions with Islandora repositories, and folks interested in migrating to Islandora are especially encouraged to attend.
      What will we be doing?
      Plans for the hack/doc are still being formed, but on one of the days you can expect to be introduced to Docker and use ISLE to spin up a full Islandora 7x stack (documentation and friendly ISLE teachers included). Other activities may include improving ISLE testing and documentation; creating workflows for the maintenance of ISLE installations; and discussions about migration, future phases of the ISLE project, coordinating ISLE with Islandora CLAW, and a planned "liberal arts sprint" to develop more robust institutional repository features in Islandora. Finally, you can expect to meet folks, build networks, and personally help to make ISLE more responsive and useful for the Islandora community.
      What about the venue/food/travel/etc.?
      We will follow up with schedules, any do-ahead work, and any other necessary information for registered attendees. For more logistics information, please follow this space: https://goo.gl/mdsyyo.

      How to Take the Lead: Leveraging your role as a problem-solver in your institution
      The facilitators of this session will use their own experiences to help participants fill the role of “internal consultants,” employees who “influence [their institutions] through credibility, expertise, skills, knowledge and understanding and to change something.” The workshop will offer practical methods of:· Filling the role of an internal consultant· Explaining your value to committees that solve problems and take advantage of opportunities· Identifying, understanding, and solving the institutions' problems and opportunities to help the institution realize their full potential· Helping find solutions by, for example, searching the literature and facilitating brainstorming sessions with other employeesThis session will consist of an hour-long interactive talk by Sheryl Ramer and Deborah Goss, who have begun to view themselves as internal consultants, followed by several short presentations by librarians who have helped institutions to solve problems.

      Introducing Historypin’s Storybox: Community Memory and Social Change
      Historypin’s Storybox, launching in June 2018, is a unique story sharing program that brings people together to ask big questions, share the stories of life, and illuminate the things we have in common.
      In this workshop, we’ll demonstrate hands-on story sharing sessions designed to be run in libraries and community organizations, and look at some of the science and methodologies behind this approach.
      Learning outcomes include: how to facilitate community conversations around shared local history; how to utilize a theory of change to measure social impact in library civic engagement programs; why story sharing is more effective than information-based treatments in driving attitude change.
      Session agenda:

      4:00-4:10 PM, Intro to Historypin and Storybox
      4:10-5:00 PM, Abbreviated story session
      5:00-5:10 PM, Break
      5:10-5:40 PM, Methods behind Storybox and a variety of ways to design civic engagement programs in your community
      5:40-6:00 PM, Q&A


      About our instructor:
      Based in New Orleans, Jon is the Director of  Shift Inc (US), part of a global non-profit that designs consumer products and builds social ventures to help solve social problems. He is also Strategic Partnerships Director for Historypin, where more than 4,000 cultural heritage organizations are working to strengthen communities through intergenerational and intercultural storytelling and local history.
      Jon co-founded the International Linked Open Data in Libraries, Archives & Museum Summit in 2011 to help build an open ecosystem of historical data across libraries, archives, and museums worldwide. In 2016, he co-founded the Cultural Heritage and Social Change Summit to bring together cultural heritage professionals to address issues of cultural equity in our collective narrative of history.

      Working in the Digital Art Landscape

      This workshop will teach the basics of operating within a creative landscape that requires manipulation and creation of assets for print and digital media. Participants will gain an overall understanding of the tools available in Adobe’s Creative Suite and how they work together to create usable, quality content.

      Need to edit a photo, prepare files for a printer, or make a GIF? The workshop will cover:
      Photoshop Basics - Uses and Goals

      File Setup: Sizing and Resolution
      Photo Editing: Non-Destructive Editing and Adjustments

      Illustrator Basics - Uses and Integration

      Raster vs Vector: Best Practices and Use Cases
      Workflows between Creative Suite Applications

      Indesign Basics - Layout and Integration

      Formatting for Print


      By the end of the class, participants will be able to work within the Creative Suite and format content for various platforms. While we plan to walk through a project that touches upon all of the above areas, participants are encouraged to bring questions related to their own work or design initiatives.

      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Please have Adobe Creative Suite pre-loaded. If you don't own a license, you can download a free, 7-day trial version of Creative Cloud here.

      Teaching Research Data Management and Reproducibility: Ways to Engage Your Community in Research Stewardship

      By understanding researchers' workflows, teaching data management is that much more efficient. In this session, Vicky Steeves (Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, New York University) will give an introduction to those looking to start offering services around research data management and reproducibility.
      Steeves will introduce the concepts, terminology, and best practices of data management and reproducibility from both the perspective of librarians and researchers. Steeves will also demonstrate existing open-source infrastructure and workflows that enable best practices in data management and working more with more reproducibility. Participants will experiment with online tools, engage in discussions, and work on small group activities. Folks walking away from this workshop will have a better idea of how to engage with researchers on these topics, offer more research services, and foster a community of stewardship within their institutions.

      Learning objectives:

      Participants will gain an understanding of some basic concepts in data management and reproducibility
      Participants will know about available tools that help work towards research reproducibility
      Participants will understand how to offer and scale services around data management and reproducibility
      Participants will be able to, at the very least, know what to look up when Googling


      This is an introductory workshop; no prerequisite knowledge or experience is required.

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)

      through a shared MeetUp page and emails. We will also make it clear to everyone
      which meetings are focused on Interlibrary Loan and which are focused on Circulation
      and Reserves so that you can attend either one (or both, if you like!). This
      meeting will be focused on Interlibrary Loan, but everyone is welcome.</p> <p>Hope
      to see you there!</p> <p>Best,</p> <p>Emma Raub &amp; Beth Posner</p> "

      Intro to Code: Javascript, data, and poetry
      This workshop is a beginner-friendly introduction to coding as a hands-on, sketch-driven exploration of basic computer concepts. We'll use Javascript to learn how to create data types and program control flow (i.e., loops, if statements), how data enters and exits a computer, and to build a basic understanding of computing concepts. Awareness of the shifting boundary between human and computer language teaches us how computers excel and how we can shape the flexible parts of our ideas to make our lives easier. The workshop will culminate with writing our own Markov chains and poetry zines generated from literary texts from Project Gutenberg.

      Students will learn the basic vocabulary of computer code, basic javascript, how to make an interactive HTML page, and how to parse and store data that comes in from the internet.

      This workshop is for students who have experience with computers like using a keyboard and navigating your way around folders. However, no coding experience is required.

      Topics covered will include:


      What is code? Human and computer languages


      Peeking inside of files - the rich text file format


      HTML and CSS in under 5 minutes


      3 things computers can do in a program: storage, algebra/compare, and control flow


      Interactive javascript applications inside of HTML files



      Text games


      Drawing with the mouse



      Fetching data from the internet with JQuery


      Generative content with Markov chains



      What to bring:


      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00). Windows, Mac, or Linux are all good. Chromebooks won't work as local file storage is required.Please have the following two programs pre-loaded:



      Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/


      Chrome Browser: https://www.google.com/chrome/
