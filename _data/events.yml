      primary purpose is to provide a point of service on the SVA campus' west side,
      the space also includes new features such as a wide screen with dual projectors
      and a gaming room with both traditional consoles and virtual reality systems.
      The library has partnered with other departments to plan a wide range of events
      held in Library West, including game nights, film screenings, poetry readings,
      and a series focused on SVA's Visual Narrative MFA program.</p> <p>Please join
      us for a tour of the new space, and hear how SVA has been using it to expand
      access and services. We'll meet up in the front lobby, near the security desk,
      at 133/141 West 21st Street, between Sixth and Seventh Aves.</p> <p>RSVP required.

      Code, Craft & Catalogues: Arts in the LibrariesWhat role do the arts and design play in today’s libraries? Our major public institutions frequently commission high-profile public art, some libraries feature dedicated exhibition space, and artists and designers have long drawn inspiration from archival and library collections. Yet today, as we access and create knowledge through an expanding array of designed platforms and interfaces, infrastructures and algorithms, aesthetic operations are integral to the core services that libraries provide. We see a growing number of library- and archive-based artists’ residencies and exhibitions, and expanding interest in more sustained collaborations across the library and art worlds. In this symposium we gather librarians, artists, designers, and representatives from allied fields to examine recent examples of library-centered creative practice, discuss the mutual benefits of such collaborations, and propose new models for growing and sustaining these partnerships.

      by the census. More than just a ten-year population count, the US Census is
      a vast ecosystem of datasets that can be used for describing places and groups
