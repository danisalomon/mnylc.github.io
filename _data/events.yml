      We invite you to a lecture and collection tour of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Hamm Archives. The Hamm Archives tell the 150-year history of BAM, but they also tell a story of the people and communities—civic and artistic—that made BAM what it is today. The Archives provide a rich and unique resource for those interested in BAM artists, the history of performing arts in the U.S., and in Brooklyn's social history.Comprised of approximately 3,000 linear feet of documents and photographs dating from 1857 to the present, the Archives includes items such as playbills, posters, architectural plans, administrative files, production records, press clippings, and video. The collection is housed at the BAM Hamm Archives Center in a modernized facility at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights.The visit will include a talk on the unique materials held in the Hamm Archives, as well as projects undertaken for the recent launch of the Leon Levy Digital Collection, the Archives’ online digital collection containing over 25,000 images and documents.
      Please note that this event is open to METRO institutional and individual members only. There is no fee to attend, but registration is required.

    html: Planning for Programming Success
  description:
    text: "The recipe for successful public programming at a library is complex. It
      is a mixture of knowing your community, keeping track of trends, advance planning,
      marketing, project management, and persistence. The devil is truly in the details.\nPublic
      programming allows library staff to bring a variety of opportunities for learning,
      engaging, entertaining, and building connections across all age groups to the
      communities we serve. Programming has seen tremendous growth in the last decade
      in terms scope and variety and has become a core service to the mission of libraries.
      Planning and running programs is no longer something extra to be done in spare
      time. Like any other core service, it requires careful planning, tracking and
      evaluation.\nThis practical workshop will examine current trends in programming
      for adult audiences at public libraries and also explore a variety of project
      management techniques that can be used to ensure that all goes smoothly during
      every phase of planning.\nThis workshop will demonstrate and examine the following
      topics:\n\n\nMethods for evaluating current programs and key steps to creating
      a long range programming plan\n\n\nProject management forms that allow for organization
      and tracking of multiple programs\n\n\nAssessment tools that allow for collection
      of both qualitative and quantitative data about programs\n\n\nCurrent trends
      in programming for adult audiences at public libraries\n\n\nNo previous experience
      or knowledge is required.\n\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper\n\n\n\nAbout
      our instructor:\nJanie Hermann, in her role as Public Programming Librarian
      at the Princeton Public Library, oversees the more than 2,000 public programs
      put together by the amazing team she is privileged to work with. Her work at
      the library allows her to interact with a wide variety of local groups and organizations
      and she is dedicated to ensuring the public programs offered at the library
      not only meet but exceed the expectations of the Princeton community. She was
      named an LJ Mover and Shaker in 2007, has served on the NJ State Library’s Blue
      Ribbon Task Force on the Future of Libraries and is involved in many capacities
      with ALA, most notably as chair of the Programming Librarian Interest Group.
      As a teacher, librarian, wife and mother, Janie has learned that minute details
      can have a big impact and that planning is crucial, but you still have to leave
      room for some spontaneous actions.\n\n"
