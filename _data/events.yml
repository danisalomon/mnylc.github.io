      Safeguarding and Activating Digital Video Information in Cultural Institutions
      In cultural organizations, internally-produced digital video materials often function both as vital information resources and as conduits for public engagement. As key components of institutional memory, these assets undoubtedly deserve to be safeguarded for future access. But implementing effective storage and access infrastructures for digital media can prove challenging, especially for organizations equipped with limited funding and staff.
      Co-organized by the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO) and the National Digital Stewardship Residency for Art Information (NDSR Art), this panel will bring together specialists from a diverse range of institutional contexts to share their experiences preserving and activating digital video.
      NDSR Art is a partnership of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and ARLIS/NA, made possible with generous funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) via a 2016 Laura Bush 21st-Century Librarian Program grant.
      Panelists:
      Amye McCarther, Archivist and Media Conservator; New Museum
      Dave Rice, Archivist; CUNY Television
      Ben Fino-Radin, Founder and Lead Conservator; Small Data Industries
      Farris Wahbeh, Benjamin and Irma Weiss Director of Research Resources; Whitney Museum of American Art
      Panel Moderator:
      Jean Moylan, 2018-19 National Digital Stewardship Residency for Art Information fellow; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum

      Reception to follow:
      6:00-7:00 p.m.
      The Landmark Tavern
      626 11th Avenue
      New York, NY 10036

    text: "We all know that workshops and one-shots have varying degrees of success
      meeting students’ information literacy needs. Attendance, student engagement,
      and faculty buy-in are all impediments to success. What if you could turn your
      ideas into a multi-session course, giving you control of the curriculum and
      learning outcomes? During this day-long workshop intended for academic librarians,
      participants will take a topic they are interested in and turn it into a multi-session
      course. In the morning we will focus on course development, including determining
      learning outcomes and scaffolding assignments. In the afternoon we will focus
      on pedagogy, including creating lesson plans and leading a class session. We
      will also brainstorm ways to adapt this model to individual environments (based
      on needs, resources, staffing strengths/limitations, etc.). This workshop is
      hands-on. Participants are asked to come with an idea for a class in mind (for
      example: What is something you are interested in teaching more in-depth? What
      is a skill faculty say students are lacking? What topic would add to your school's
      curriculum?), as well as an internet-enabled device for independent and group
      work (laptop, tablet, etc.). Participants will come away with a rough syllabus
      for a multi-session course, a few lesson plans/assignments geared towards their
      topic, and an understanding of how to facilitate class sessions. \n\nWhat to

      school, and academic libraries in NY and MA. She has taught classes at the high
      school and undergraduate level both in-person and online, as well as numerous
      workshops for patrons of all ages. Most recently, she helped develop an information
      studies curriculum at Simon’s Rock consisting of ten, one-credit, half-semester
      (seven week) courses taught by librarians that provide opportunities for students
      to develop metaliteracy and resilience within academia and beyond. KellyAnne

    text: "It's the year 2039. Where's your podcast? (A Preserve This Podcast workshop)\nBring
      your hard drives. Bring your laptops. Bring your Dropbox password. We’re going
      to preserve your podcast.\nIf you’ve listened to our podcast or read our zine,
      you know that podcasts are disappearing. So how can podcasters protect themselves
      against loss? By attending our first-ever Preserve This Podcast workshop. This
      interactive workshop will tackle this issue head-on by walking audio creators
      through the history of podcast technology, the basics of archival preservation,
      and simple steps you can take to preserve your audio. We will review through
      the tools and techniques to prevent data loss before it’s too late, as well
      as “bake” these concepts into podcasters’ existing production workflows.\n\nAbout
      our instructors:\n\n\nDana Gerber-Margie listens to podcasts while living in
      Madison, Wisconsin. She earned her Master's in Library & Information Studies
      at UW-Madison, and has worked as an A/V Archivist for WiLS and the Wisconsin
      Historical Society. She is the co-founder and co-editor of the Bello Collective,
      a publication about podcasts and storytelling.\nMary Kidd is an archivist and

      Division. She has worked on audio/visual preservation projects for New York
      Public Radio, the Magic Shop Recording Studio, and the XFR Collective, a non-profit
      organization that transfers at-risk media off magnetic tapes to digital format
      for individuals and groups with limited means. She enjoys creating drawings,
      zines, gifs, and other artful tidbits to make archiving, and the technology
      that supports it, accessible, approachable and fun for everyone.\n\n\n\nMolly
      Schwartz produces podcasts and writes about tech. She is the Studio Manager
      at the Metropolitan New York Library Council (METRO). She did a Fulbright grant
      at the Aalto University Media Lab in Helsinki and worked at the U.S. State Department
