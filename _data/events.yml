       We had such a productive meeting and I am glad to say that we are ready to
      move forward with a concrete action towards racial justice in libraries and
      archives:</p> <p>• Creating a toolkit to hire and retain POC in libraries and
      archives.</p> <p>     •Outreach</p> <p>     •Resources for hiring managers</p>
      <p>     • Skills for doing anti-racist work in libraries</p> <p>As a first step
      to tackling this big project, you’re invited to join a discussion about hiring
      and retention in our profession, centered around recent events in Evanston Public
      Library. Check out these resources and come ready to share, listen, and learn:</p>

    html: 'Bibliographic Data as Linked Open Data: The BIBFRAME initiative'
  description:
    text: "Libraries have a long history of sharing metadata since 1968, primarily
      because of the widely implemented MARC 21 formats. With new ways to share information
      and the promise of enhancing discovery on the Semantic Web, libraries and other
      cultural heritage institutions have explored how to make their bibliographic
      data and vocabularies available as Linked Open Data to expose their information
      resources more easily to the wider world of the Web. Because of the large infrastructure
      in place that supports creating, sharing and managing bibliographic data built
      around MARC, replacing it is a monumental task requiring world-wide input and
      experimentation.  In 2011, the Library of Congress embarked on an initiative
      to move rich bibliographic data into a Linked Data model with the Bibliographic
      Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME), providing a framework and language to replace
      MARC. \nThe Bibliographic Framework Initiative (BIBFRAME) is both a general
      model for expressing and connecting bibliographic data utilizing Linked Data
      principles as well as a framework for describing information objects that intends
      to be compatible with previous bibliographic practices. After early experimentation,
      the initiative has matured and several projects are experimenting with its vocabulary
      and related ones, and developing tools to support it. This session introduces
      Linked Data concepts relevant to bibliographic data and how MARC records could
      be envisioned as Linked Data statements. It traces the development of BIBFRAME
      since the release of its initial data model and version 1 of the BIBFRAME vocabulary,
      provides an overview of the BIBFRAME vocabulary version 2.0, and demonstrates
      tools that transform MARC records and enable creation of BIBFRAME descriptions.\nA
      case study of experimentation will be presented. ArtFrame, which is led by Columbia
      University Libraries, is a domain-specific sub-project of Linked Data for Production
      (LD4P), a Mellon-funded cross-institutional effort aimed at piloting the production
      of linked data in libraries. The ArtFrame vocabulary is an extension of BIBFRAME
      and LD4P/LD4L-Lab's bibliotek-o ontologies to describe works of art (both two-dimensional
      and three-dimensional) natively as linked data. Columbia University staff and
      the ArtFrame extension group have collected use cases arising in art cataloging,
      evaluated how well these use cases can be expressed using BIBFRAME and bibliotek-o
      and developed alternative proposals as deemed necessary. The group is currently
      working on developing the ontology files and an application profile.\nThis event
      is intended for professionals and students who are interested in learning about
      the evolution of BIBFRAME, how it models bibliographic data as Linked Data,
      and plans for experimenting and implementing a Linked Data compatible bibliographic
      vocabulary.\nWho should attend: Librarians, archivists, and museum professionals
      who are involved in creating or maintaining metadata for their resources as
      well as students investigating bibliographic data in a Linked Data framework.
      A familiarity with MARC is assumed.\nPlease bring laptops if available.\nAfter
      attending this workshop, you will:\n\n\nUnderstand the principles of Linked
      Data and how a bibliographic record could be deconstructed into Linked Data
      statements\n\n\nGain knowledge of the BIBFRAME model and how it applies to different
      types of information resources\n\n\nObtain an overview of the BIBFRAME vocabulary
      and how it is extended by other Linked Data compatible vocabularies and ontologies\n\n\nSee
      how existing MARC records are transformed to BIBFRAME\n\n\nLearn about projects
      that are experimenting with BIBFRAME and related ontologies \n\n\nInstructor

    html: Labor Organizing for Information Workers
  description:
    text: |-
      In an era of unprecedented attacks on information workers, how can we mobilize to advocate for our own wages and working conditions? The facilitators will use their experience organizing during the faculty lockout at LIU Brooklyn in September 2016 to inform participatory activities that will help attendees understand the basics of union organizing in their own workplaces.The first half of the session will introduce the basics of getting to know your workplace. Union organizing relies on understanding who is in your unit, what their workplace needs and priorities are, and their level of engagement and commitment to union activity. Central to this process are lists of members that can be regularly updated and assessed as organizing and action proceeds. It is also critical to understand where members are in the organization so that connections between people can be made. Maps can be useful tools for this work. Attendees will leave with the beginnings of a list and map for further organizing.The second half of the session will focus on the organizing conversation. These are conversations where unit members come to understand shared concerns and begin to strategize for taking action. Attendees will gain hands on practice engaging the five steps of the organizing conversation.We expect attendees will leave the session with new tools to reinvigorate their engagement with workplace justice issues whether they are currently in a union or considering forming one.

      Sound Advice: Affordable, Responsible Practices for Producing and Managing Audio Content
      This workshop will cover the ways in which oral historians, podcasters, and recorders of public presentations can best prepare their materials for archival ingest.
      Brett Dion, our workshop instructor, will recommend best practices for applying budget-minded audio technology during recording, post-production, and storage. He will discuss interview environments, microphone placement, audio basics and troubleshooting, file formats, recording gear, metadata, alternatives to outsourcing transcription, and working with the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer.
      Participants will learn:


      how to prepare for an audio recording, including best practices, good practices and best-to-avoid practices


      recommended approaches to preserving master recordings, plus editing and compressing derivative copies


      indexing the recording content as an alternative to transcription


      the basics of the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer


      Laptops are required for this course.
      About our instructor

      Project Management. 

      Those words can carry an intimidating aura of official methodologies and tools you’re ‘supposed’ to use, words like Agile, Kanban, Jira, gantt charts. However, successful project management is often simpler than these terms would imply. It all boils down to good communication and information management - practices librarians are especially skilled at. 


      In this workshop, we’ll peel back the jargon around project management to get back to these first principles of communication and information management, and how they are expressed in good project management artifacts, routines, and tools. We’ll also work through case study exercises together.

      By understanding what is fundementally important to project management, you’ll be able to adapt your style and assess the right tools for different situations as the context demands, because projects and project management approaches aren’t one-size fits all.

      After this session, participants will:

      Have an understanding that project management requires good communication and information management
      Know how to assess the right tools for their project
      Know how to produce good written artifacts like meeting notes, project charters, and plans + practice good habits

      About our instructor:
      Ara Kim has spent her career pursuing interests in linguistics, culture, technology, and organizational behavior and has held a number of leadership positions at the intersection of these subjects. She is a co-founder of Related Works, a sustainable business building well-designed tools for cultural institutions to manage their digital materials, and consults on operational process at places like Data and Society and The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Previously, she held various product and project management positions at NYPL Labs, Google, and Etsy.

  description:
    text: |
      It’s in your browser. Your operating system. Your phone. Your car. Your automated home assistant. And of course, it’s on your institution's public website. Search is everywhere. But most users, and even most administrators or engineers, know very little about what happens behind the scenes when you type something into that proverbial textbox. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive to understand how Search works from the ground up. We’ll cover classic information retrieval subjects like:


      Inverted Index


      Analysis


      Tokenization


      Character Normalization


      Stemming / Lemmatization


      Stopwords


      Synonyms


      Ranking


      TFIDF/BM25


      We’ll also briefly talk about the components that make modern search engines like Google orders of magnitude more intelligent and resilient than these classic technique

      About our instructor:
      Gio has been working with data, architecting systems, and leading teams of engineers for over a decade. He’s currently a co-founder at Related Works (www.relatedworks.io), which aims to build simple, intelligent products that help cultural institutions share their collections with the world. Previously he worked as a Staff Engineer at Etsy, where he lead the Search Ranking and Search Experience teams.

      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and

      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and

      they impact the final design.Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
