  description:
    text: "Trainer: Julia Martin, The Accompany Project / the Arab American Association
      of New York\nWhy this workshop?\nHate crimes are on the rise across the country,
      and in NYC there have been multiple incidents of harassment or aggression since
      elections. In times like these, it is important to know how to successfully
      and safely disrupt a hostile or aggressive situation you may witness, and to
      ensure your actions are more helpful than harmful. This workshop will also explore
      the role of race and gender during an intervention, and will help provide a
      space for participants to evaluate their role in high risk situations. \nMore
      about bystander intervention:\nBystander intervention involves a series of tools
      that can be consciously employed to defuse volatile situations. In this interactive
      workshop, bystander intervention and de-escalation will be presented in the
      context of harm reduction and self-defense. Participants will identify verbal
      and non-verbal techniques and tactics to de-escalate conflict. Participants
      will also learn the four Ds of bystander intervention – direct, distract, delay,
      and delegate. \nWhat is the format of this training?\nThe training is a combination
      of instruction as well as participant interaction. Participants will be asked
      to act out scenarios of intervention, using the skills they have learned.\nIs
      this training free?\nSuggested donation is $20 for those who are able to contribute.
      No one will be turned away for lack of pay.\nWhat is the Arab American Association
      of New York, and why are they offering this session?\nWe are a social service
      and advocacy agency that serves the largest Arab community in NYC. Leading up
      to and since the election, our community members - Muslim women in particular,
      are often the victims of these attacks of aggression and hostility. We want
      to encourage as many people as possible to safely and successfully intervene
      in a volatile situation, and catalyze folks to take action in their neighborhoods
      to protect their neighbors. Bystander intervention is one way to have the back
      of your fellow New Yorkers.\nWho is welcome to participate?\nThe trainings are
      open to all - they are not intended exclusively for allies. The training will
      help us to understand how our race, gender, religion, and other elements of
      our identity inform how we intervene.\nPlease note: this workshop is open to
      all, but attendance is capped to ensure the session remains safe and interactive.
      You *must* RSVP via EventBrite in order to attend. Please note, additional sessions
      will be scheduled throughout the city at least weekly for the next few months.
      Contact kayla@arabamericanny.org if you would like to arrange a training in
      your neighborhood, or for any questions you may have.\n"
