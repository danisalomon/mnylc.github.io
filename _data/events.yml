      Web Archiving for All! An Introduction to Webrecorder
      In this session, we will talk about ways to collect web content via free, open source software that runs in a web browser (Webrecorder.io). With a model of human-directed collecting (one page at a time), Webrecorder significantly lowers the barrier to collecting web content. Attendees will be given a high-level overview of Webrecorder’s features and engage in hands-on activities.

      Web archiving is important to the library/information field because, while so much contemporary culture takes shape or only exists online, this information is very susceptible to frequent change and loss. Selecting and collecting from social media will be important to represent current culture in New York and well beyond in the near and distant future. Many resources collected by libraries and archives, such as annual reports and course catalogs, are often no longer published on paper, but do get published to the web, so web archiving is essential to maintain or extend certain collections. With a tool like Webrecorder, anyone can get started with web archiving quickly, which is empowering both to information professionals/librarians and the communities they serve (especially if users are given information about using Webrecorder themselves).

      During this session, participants will:


      Learn how to employ user-friendly, open source, browser-based software for archiving web content at no cost (Webrecorder).


      Gain information on options for downloading web archives (WARC files) and get experience with software for accessing web archives (Webrecorder Player).


      Leave with the ability to describe, manage and share their web collections online (via Webrecorder.io).



      No experience is expected or necessary. If you can browse the web you can collect with Webrecorder!

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). Please have Firefox or Chrome installed. Installing Webrecorder Player, which is freely available from Github, would be helpful but is not required.


      Agenda:


      Hour 1:



      Introductions, participants share goals/anticipated use cases


      Overview of Webrecorder.io’s core tool sets followed by question time and brief discussion


      Hands on activity to sign up for account, capture sample collection and review sample collection


      Participants check back with group to discuss/reflect on progress



      Hour 2:



      Prompts or questions will be given to help participants envision how they could form meaningful small scale collections or augmentations to larger collections then start forming those collections while in this workshop. This can be done individually or in groups of 2-3 if participants would like to team up


      Introduction to using pre-configured (remote) browsers and importing from public web archives


      Overview of description, management and sharing features followed by an exercise to use these tools



      Hour 3:



      Demo of Webrecorder Player, an application for accessing/interacting with WARC files offline. Collections created earlier in the workshop can be downloaded and viewed in Webrecorder Player


      Discuss the components of the practice of web archiving and explore how they could fit into existing and emerging digital preservation workflows through discussion  


      If any time remains it can be used for further discussions, Q&A and/or ‘lab time’

  description:
    text: |-
      It seems like every day we hear about clinician burnout and its devastating effects on physicians, nurses and other healthcare providers. We have also seen a rise in wellness programs in the workplace and initiatives championed by institutions like AMA, The National Academy of Medicine, Stanford Medicine, and others. As information professionals in hospital and healthcare settings, we may witness the toll taken on those around us, and feel the effects as well.
      But what is burnout? Why is it suddenly everywhere in the news? What can we as librarians do about it?
      In this session we will explore what burnout is, what makes a successful workplace wellness program, and how we can participate in and support wellness programs. We will also learn techniques to manage our own stress through guided meditation.
      A follow-up resource guide will be provided to all attendees.

      very wrong” — Jaron Lanier<br/>“The internet is terrible now” — Tim Wu<br/>“The
      net has heaps of problems” — Tim Berners-Lee</p> <p>The Internet has gone through
      some changes, and not for the better. Whereas the early Internet felt like an
      expression of collectivity, a miracle of human connection full of endless potential,
      now for many it feels ominous, corporate, predatory, and extortionate, enabling
      surveillance and authoritarianism, a wasteland littered with unintended consequences.</p>
      <p>But do not fear: Internet idealists are working hard to rebuild the Internet
      We Want, creating new decentralized systems to route around gatekeepers and
      racketeers. Advocates for decentralization in infrastructure claim we can create
      a new digital utopia: build healthy digital ecosystems, level playing fields,
      bring back open digital public spaces, and provide opportunity for all.</p>
      <p>But will our new digital utopia inevitably fall prey to unintended consequences
      as well?</p> <p>Join us for a discussion of decentralized upstarts that are
      challenging the Internet gatekeepers: community mesh networks, upstart platform
      coops, blockchain data systems, crypto-everything. Can renegade tech save our
      digital future? Or -- by adopting the principles of decentralization, could
      we end up hardening our Internet bubbles into fragmented physical infrastructure
      and competing reality regimes and fiefdoms? And what would that world look like
      for equity in general if other stratifications continue to harden — income inequality,
      political polarization, predatory automation, climate injustice? Bring your
      ideas about what it might take to intentionally build consent, equity, and joy
      into a more hopeful digital future.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Doors open at 6:30 p.m.
