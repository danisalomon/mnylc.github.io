      In 1964, noted literary critic Leslie Fiedler described American youth as “new mutants,” social rebels severing their attachments to American culture to remake themselves in their own image. In this talk, Ramzi Fawaz explores how 1960s comic book creators, anticipating Fiedler, began to morph American superheroes from icons of nationalism and white masculinity into actual mutant outcasts, defined by their genetic difference from ordinary humanity.
      These powerful misfits and “freaks” soon came to embody the social and political aspirations of America’s most marginalized groups, including women, racial and sexual minorities, and the working classes. Examining a range of comic book series including the Justice League of America, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men, Fawaz shows how these comics provided readers an exceptionally diverse range of new characters and creative worlds to interact with while modeling ways of bridging divides of race, species, kin and kind for their mutual flourishing and the good of the world.
      About our speaker: Ramzi Fawaz is assistant professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is the author of The New Mutants: Superheroes and the Radical Imagination of American Comics (NYU Press, 2016), which won the 2012 Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies Fellowship Award for best first book manuscript in LGBT Studies. His work has been published in numerous journals including American Literature, GLQ, ASAP/Journal, Feminist Studies, and Callaloo. He is currently co-editing a special issue of American Literature with Darieck Scott titled "Queer About Comics," and a special issue of GLQ with Shanté Smalls titled "Queers Read This: LGBTQ Literature Now."

      the ideas behind community engagement. We'll walk through the preparation process
      for these types of experiences: setting goals, choosing the appropriate framework,
      identifying stakeholders, and working through planning and logistics. We will
      discuss the role of the facilitator in introducing opportunities to guide the

      This class will cover the basics of creating a podcast, from recording and editing to transcription and dissemination. You will come away with tools and examples to help you get started recording interviews, structuring narratives, editing large volumes of tape, and using archival sound.
      The skills you learn in the class will be applicable for podcasting, oral history, and audio documentary projects. The workshop is appropriate for beginners and those with some level of recording experience who are looking to learn more about the craft of structuring audio stories.
      By the end of this workshop, you can expect to be able to:

      create a short audio recording
      edit sound files
      creating transcriptions
      highlighting the overarching story within your recording

      We will work through a short homework assignment during our "week off" from this course.

  description:
    text: |-
      Using prominent texts from the field of culturally relevant education -- particularly literacy education, as well as anecdotes from everyday life, and library and teaching experiences -- this course will prepare library workers and educators to build awareness about race, class, gender, sexuality and develop language to engage in conversations around these topics in their workplaces and communities. This workshops will help participants advocate for all people’s access to relevant materials, create meaningful programs, and enhance day-to-day library practice.
      By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

      Situate themselves within US cultural context and a local context
      Reflect on how texts have shaped their personal identity and how it can shape those of students and patrons
      Reflect on daily work experiences as a mode of professional learning about cultural context
      Develop an understanding of why and how to think critically about text choices   
      Brainstorm strategies for bringing these practices into their local contexts and workplaces
      Practice having conversations about challenging issues in libraries

      About our facilitators
      Jessica Hochman is an assistant professor at Pratt Institute School of Information. She teaches courses on teaching and learning in libraries, whether and how to use technology for instruction, and intersectionality. Research interests include the nexus of youth culture and technology, informal literacy practices, discourses of teaching and teachers, and feminist theory and practice. 
      Tonya Leslie is an educational consultant specializing in culturally responsive practices for schools, libraries and other educational organizations. She has a PhD in teaching and learning from NYU where she worked at the Metropolitan Center for Research and Transformation of Schools supporting school districts nationally to develop strategies for closing achievement gaps and improving systems for equitable outcomes. Her research explores how multiple literacies influence identity development and academic resilience.

      Project Management. 

      Those words can carry an intimidating aura of official methodologies and tools you’re ‘supposed’ to use, words like Agile, Kanban, Jira, gantt charts. However, successful project management is often simpler than these terms would imply. It all boils down to good communication and information management - practices librarians are especially skilled at. 


      In this workshop, we’ll peel back the jargon around project management to get back to these first principles of communication and information management, and how they are expressed in good project management artifacts, routines, and tools. We’ll also work through case study exercises together.

      By understanding what is fundementally important to project management, you’ll be able to adapt your style and assess the right tools for different situations as the context demands, because projects and project management approaches aren’t one-size fits all.

      After this session, participants will:

      Have an understanding that project management requires good communication and information management
      Know how to assess the right tools for their project
      Know how to produce good written artifacts like meeting notes, project charters, and plans + practice good habits

      About our instructor:
      Ara Kim has spent her career pursuing interests in linguistics, culture, technology, and organizational behavior and has held a number of leadership positions at the intersection of these subjects. She is a co-founder of Related Works, a sustainable business building well-designed tools for cultural institutions to manage their digital materials, and consults on operational process at places like Data and Society and The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Previously, she held various product and project management positions at NYPL Labs, Google, and Etsy.

    html: How Do Search Engines Work?
  description:
    text: |
      It’s in your browser. Your operating system. Your phone. Your car. Your automated home assistant. And of course, it’s on your institution's public website. Search is everywhere. But most users, and even most administrators or engineers, know very little about what happens behind the scenes when you type something into that proverbial textbox. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive to understand how Search works from the ground up. We’ll cover classic information retrieval subjects like:


      Inverted Index


      Analysis


      Tokenization


      Character Normalization


      Stemming / Lemmatization


      Stopwords


      Synonyms


      Ranking


      TFIDF/BM25


      We’ll also briefly talk about the components that make modern search engines like Google orders of magnitude more intelligent and resilient than these classic technique

      About our instructor:
      Gio has been working with data, architecting systems, and leading teams of engineers for over a decade. He’s currently a co-founder at Related Works (www.relatedworks.io), which aims to build simple, intelligent products that help cultural institutions share their collections with the world. Previously he worked as a Staff Engineer at Etsy, where he lead the Search Ranking and Search Experience teams.

    html: The Universal Elements of Good Design
  description:
    text: "Everything in our lives was designed by someone, from the alarm that wakes
      us up in the morning to the book we read before going to bed. Across the myriad
      of objects, tools, and apps that we use every day, they were designed using
      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and
      sound. \nIn this three-hour workshop, we’re going to break up our time into
      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and
      review a variety of real world print and interactive examples to discuss how
      they impact the final design.Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
      and put them into practice together.\nNo previous design experience required
      to participate. This workshop is great for those that have an interest in design
      but have had little to no previous training.\nBy the end of this workshop, participants
      will have:\n\n\nAn understanding of the fundamental building blocks every designer
      uses in their work to create effective and compelling visual designs\n\n\nHow
      to use these fundamental building blocks to design for print and screen\n\n\nHands-on
      practice establishing designing and leveraging space, typography, color, and
      motion, and sound to create a unique visual language\n\n\n\nAbout our Instructor:Magera
      Holton, Co-founder at Related Works believes the best design is the one you’re
      least likely to notice. She most recently managed the Design Systems Team at
      Etsy, responsible for building core UX components and design guidelines utilized
      by product teams every day across the organization. She managed Buyer Experience,
      which focused on streamlining the purchasing experience and bringing Etsy’s
      unique content to the forefront. \nAs an individual contributor at Etsy, she
      patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows:
      checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at
      Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling
      the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not
      thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over
      renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.\n"

      <P>As an individual contributor at Etsy, she patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows: checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.</P>

  description:
    text: "Libraries both large and small need to garner input from donors, patrons,
      and other community stakeholders when making important decisions. This training
      will help you build a toolkit of techniques and approaches for facilitating
      productive brainstorms, planning, and decision-making meetings.  \nIn this workshop,
      we’ll first focus on clarifying the collaborative participatory decision-making
      process; interactively demonstrating how to lead a series of activities and
      methodologies, best practices for setting and managing expectations, while supporting
      productive conversations.  Then we’ll outline how these types of activities
      fit into a problem-solving process, the typical information it collects, strengths
      and limitations, and using the mapping process to generate ideas and lead productive
      conversations.\nAt the end of the workshop, participants will have the tools
      to:\n\n\nuse and lead different methodologies and activities for group decision-making\n\n\nto
      arrive at a consensus (and when not to) \n\n\nto guide pivoting conversations
      while addressing constraints \n\n\n------\nAbout our instructor\nKristina Drury
