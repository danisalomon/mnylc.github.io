      Every hospital has problems to solve and opportunities to take advantage of. They need to improve patient care and satisfaction and prepare for surveys by The Joint Commission and other accrediting bodies. Nurses need to pass required courses and study for certifications and doctors need to pass their boards. Employees need to be engaged to improve recruitment and retention. As information professionals in hospitals and healthcare settings, we have the opportunity to identify issues and find ways to be pro-active in addressing them. In this session, we will explore potential information gaps and hear from vendors who sell relevant products that may be unfamiliar to many librarians.
      Speakers:


      Dawn BonsorIsabel, a differential diagnosis tool


      Michael MaiselOncourse Learning/CE Direct, an online continuing education platform for healthcare professionals

    text: "Building Solidarity: Supporting Community Organizations through Archival
      Practice\nFor the past several decades, community archives such as the Lesbian
      Herstory Archives, Densho: The Japanese American Legacy Project, and the Freedom
      Archives have been important sites of self-determination, memory, and inspiration
      for historically disenfranchised communities. In recent years, archivists and
      information workers have become increasingly interested in using their professional
      skills to support these projects. This workshop will discuss what community
      archives are and why they are important. We will review key scholars, discuss
      ethical considerations, and explore the effects of privilege in this work. Key
      tools and techniques, such as records management, DIY digitization stations,
      and non-hierarchical practice will be examined. In the afternoon, we will partner
      with local NYC organization Asian American Arts Alliance to create a thoughtful
      plan for the long-term stewardship of their records. Participants will leave
      the workshop with a theoretical grounding in the current activist and professional
      conversations around community archives, knowledge about how LIS professionals
      can support this work, suggestions for practical tools, and experience putting
      these tools into practice.\nWhat to bring: \n\n\nA pen and paper or personal
      laptop for notetaking\n\n\n\nAbout our instructors:\nAnjali Goyal is an arts
      administrator and has worked with various community-based arts nonprofits for
      the past 15 years. She is currently the Development Manager at the Asian American
      Arts Alliance in Brooklyn, NY. Marie Lascu is a graduate of NYU's Moving Image
      Archiving and Preservation program. She has been a member of the XFR Collective
      since 2015, and works as the audiovisual archivist for Crowing Rooster Arts,
      a media non-profit that has spent more than 20 years documenting the arts and
      political struggles of Haiti. Maggie Schreiner is an archivist at the Brooklyn
      Historical Society, and has been a volunteer with Interference Archive and Librarians
      and Archivists with Palestine since 2013. She is a graduate of NYU's Archives

    text: |-
      Do you face challenging behavior from library users? 
      Would you like to change, develop, or enhance relationships with patrons, colleagues, or stakeholders?

      This session explores the use of simple, inexpensive, and effective activities that build empathy, highlight obstacles to change, and help participants to find common ground for future action. We'll highlight the elements of scenario planning, collaboration, and storytelling that underpin those activities.

      Participants will:


      learn to use open-ended play activities including Library Island to elicit new ideas, highlight challenges, and develop relationships


      create a tailored roleplay of their own


      explore follow-up activities that turn play into practical outcomes


      Participants will receive a follow-up packet with additional resources, hints, and tips.

      Testimonials“Matt’s ‘Battle for Library Island’ roleplaying event opened many minds to the challenges and tensions of library service, allowing both brand-new personnel from the finance department, and old public service hands who thought they fully understood their work, to rapidly see things they do every day from a totally different perspective.”– Eli Neiburger, Deputy Director Ann Arbor District Library, Michigan, USA“Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. His “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s minds to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. ”
