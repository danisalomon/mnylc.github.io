He will discuss interview environments, microphone placement, audio basics and troubleshooting, file formats, recording gear, metadata, alternatives to outsourcing transcription, and working with the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer.
      Participants will learn:


      how to prepare for an audio recording, including best practices, good practices and best-to-avoid practices


      recommended approaches to preserving master recordings, plus editing and compressing derivative copies


      indexing the recording content as an alternative to transcription


      the basics of the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer


      Laptops are required for this course.

    text: |-
      In 1964, noted literary critic Leslie Fiedler described American youth as “new mutants,” social rebels severing their attachments to American culture to remake themselves in their own image. In this talk, Ramzi Fawaz explores how 1960s comic book creators, anticipating Fiedler, began to morph American superheroes from icons of nationalism and white masculinity into actual mutant outcasts, defined by their genetic difference from ordinary humanity.
      These powerful misfits and “freaks” soon came to embody the social and political aspirations of America’s most marginalized groups, including women, racial and sexual minorities, and the working classes. Examining a range of comic book series including the Justice League of America, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men, Fawaz shows how these comics provided readers an exceptionally diverse range of new characters and creative worlds to interact with while modeling ways of bridging divides of race, species, kin and kind for their mutual flourishing and the good of the world.
      About our speaker: Ramzi Fawaz is assistant professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He is the author of The New Mutants: Superheroes and the Radical Imagination of American Comics (NYU Press, 2016), which won the 2012 Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies Fellowship Award for best first book manuscript in LGBT Studies. His work has been published in numerous journals including American Literature, GLQ, ASAP/Journal, Feminist Studies, and Callaloo. He is currently co-editing a special issue of American Literature with Darieck Scott titled "Queer About Comics," and a special issue of GLQ with Shanté Smalls titled "Queers Read This: LGBTQ Literature Now."

      Develop an understanding of why and how to think critically about text choices   
      Brainstorm strategies for bringing these practices into their local contexts and workplaces
      Practice having conversations about challenging issues in libraries

      Project Management. 

      Those words can carry an intimidating aura of official methodologies and tools you’re ‘supposed’ to use, words like Agile, Kanban, Jira, gantt charts. However, successful project management is often simpler than these terms would imply. It all boils down to good communication and information management - practices librarians are especially skilled at. 


      In this workshop, we’ll peel back the jargon around project management to get back to these first principles of communication and information management, and how they are expressed in good project management artifacts, routines, and tools. We’ll also work through case study exercises together.

      By understanding what is fundementally important to project management, you’ll be able to adapt your style and assess the right tools for different situations as the context demands, because projects and project management approaches aren’t one-size fits all.

      After this session, participants will:

      Have an understanding that project management requires good communication and information management
      Know how to assess the right tools for their project
      Know how to produce good written artifacts like meeting notes, project charters, and plans + practice good habits

      About our instructor:
      Ara Kim has spent her career pursuing interests in linguistics, culture, technology, and organizational behavior and has held a number of leadership positions at the intersection of these subjects. She is a co-founder of Related Works, a sustainable business building well-designed tools for cultural institutions to manage their digital materials, and consults on operational process at places like Data and Society and The Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science. Previously, she held various product and project management positions at NYPL Labs, Google, and Etsy.

  description:
    text: |
      It’s in your browser. Your operating system. Your phone. Your car. Your automated home assistant. And of course, it’s on your institution's public website. Search is everywhere. But most users, and even most administrators or engineers, know very little about what happens behind the scenes when you type something into that proverbial textbox. In this talk we’ll take a deep dive to understand how Search works from the ground up. We’ll cover classic information retrieval subjects like:


      Inverted Index


      Analysis


      Tokenization


      Character Normalization


      Stemming / Lemmatization


      Stopwords


      Synonyms


      Ranking


      TFIDF/BM25


      We’ll also briefly talk about the components that make modern search engines like Google orders of magnitude more intelligent and resilient than these classic technique

      About our instructor:
      Gio has been working with data, architecting systems, and leading teams of engineers for over a decade. He’s currently a co-founder at Related Works (www.relatedworks.io), which aims to build simple, intelligent products that help cultural institutions share their collections with the world. Previously he worked as a Staff Engineer at Etsy, where he lead the Search Ranking and Search Experience teams.

      the same fundamental building blocks: space, typography, color, motion, and
      sound. \nIn this three-hour workshop, we’re going to break up our time into
      two parts. We’ll first do a deep dive into these core elements of design and
      review a variety of real world print and interactive examples to discuss how
      they impact the final design.Then we’ll take those learnings and discussion
      and put them into practice together.\nNo previous design experience required
      to participate. This workshop is great for those that have an interest in design
      but have had little to no previous training.\nBy the end of this workshop, participants
      will have:\n\n\nAn understanding of the fundamental building blocks every designer
      uses in their work to create effective and compelling visual designs\n\n\nHow
      to use these fundamental building blocks to design for print and screen\n\n\nHands-on
      practice establishing designing and leveraging space, typography, color, and
      motion, and sound to create a unique visual language\n\n\n\nAbout our Instructor:Magera
      Holton, Co-founder at Related Works believes the best design is the one you’re
      least likely to notice. She most recently managed the Design Systems Team at
      Etsy, responsible for building core UX components and design guidelines utilized
      by product teams every day across the organization. She managed Buyer Experience,
      which focused on streamlining the purchasing experience and bringing Etsy’s
      unique content to the forefront. \nAs an individual contributor at Etsy, she
      patiently deconstructed and redesigned the site’s two most critical user flows:
      checkout and the listing process. Prior to Etsy, she was the sole designer at
      Wesabe, a consumer finance startup, and spent a year freelancing while traveling
      the world. Magera received her B.F.A. in Design from UT Austin. When she’s not
      thanklessly unwinding complex user experiences, you can find her obsessing over
      renovations to her new Rockaway home. And surfing, of course.\n"
