      to creating and updating an active website have been drastically lowered in
      recent years thanks to static site generation software and low-risk options
      for web hosting. This workshop will cover how to use a popular combination for
      building low-maintenance websites: Jekyll, a blog/content-generating software

The collection is housed at the BAM Hamm Archives Center in a modernized facility at 1000 Dean Street in Crown Heights.The visit will include a talk on the unique materials held in the Hamm Archives, as well as projects undertaken for the recent launch of the Leon Levy Digital Collection, the Archives’ online digital collection containing over 25,000 images and documents.
      Please note that this event is open to METRO institutional and individual members only. There is no fee to attend, but registration is required.
