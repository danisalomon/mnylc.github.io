      Teaching Research Data Management and Reproducibility: Ways to Engage Your Community in Research Stewardship

      By understanding researchers' workflows, teaching data management is that much more efficient. In this session, Vicky Steeves (Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, New York University) will give an introduction to those looking to start offering services around research data management and reproducibility.
      Steeves will introduce the concepts, terminology, and best practices of data management and reproducibility from both the perspective of librarians and researchers. Steeves will also demonstrate existing open-source infrastructure and workflows that enable best practices in data management and working more with more reproducibility. Participants will experiment with online tools, engage in discussions, and work on small group activities. Folks walking away from this workshop will have a better idea of how to engage with researchers on these topics, offer more research services, and foster a community of stewardship within their institutions.

      Learning objectives:

      Participants will gain an understanding of some basic concepts in data management and reproducibility
      Participants will know about available tools that help work towards research reproducibility
      Participants will understand how to offer and scale services around data management and reproducibility
      Participants will be able to, at the very least, know what to look up when Googling


      This is an introductory workshop; no prerequisite knowledge or experience is required.

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's for $5.00)

    text: "Getting Started with Web Archives:A beginner's workshop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs
      our subjects, stakeholders, patrons, and donors increasingly engage each other
      and the world through online media, librarians and archivists are compelled
      to steward valuable born digital records into cohesive, preservable collections
      for future access and use. Web archiving--the process of collecting, preserving,
      and enabling access to web materials--presents a powerful opportunity for us
      to develop collections of these otherwise ephemeral resources. The most difficult
      step towards realizing this potential is often simply getting started; the daunting
      range of possible collecting scopes, policies, technologies, and workflows can
      stop a web archiving program before it starts. How does one define an achievable
      collecting mission, communicate their selection standards, and appropriate the
      necessary technical, human, and financial resources, without any practical experience
      in this emergent craft?Attendees to this workshop will overcome these obstacles
      with training and support from experts in the practice. The program will begin
      with a survey of web archiving that establishes a common level of understanding
      and language, progresses through case studies that represent the judgements
      and decisions to be made in designing a web archiving program, and conclude
      with a guided small-group exercise to design and make the first acquisitions
      into a model web archive.Specific learning objectives to this end include: understanding
      the nature and history of web archives as born digital collections; how to craft
      a mission-driven collection development policy for web archives; how to select
      among the available acquisition tools and descriptive standards to best support
      their patrons’ and stakeholders’ needs; and best practices for long-term preservation
      and access to these resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to bring:\n\n\nA laptop
      (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). \n\n\nAbout our
      instructors:Karl-Rainer Blumenthal helps organizations and individuals to build
      web archives through software support, training, testing, and documentation,
      as a web archivist for the Internet Archive’s Archive-It service. His boundless
      enthusiasm for all things web archiving developed during his term as a National
      Digital Stewardship Resident with the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC).
      He has served as the founding co-chair of the Art Libraries Society of North
      America’s Web Archiving Special Interest Group and chair of the Society of American
      Archivists’ Web Archiving Section. Select publications include “A collaborative
      model for web archiving ephemeral art resources at the New York Art Resources
      Consortium” (with Sumitra Duncan in Art Libraries Journal, 2016) and “Digital
      Preservation Metadata Practice for Web Archives” (with Clément Oury & Sébastien
      Peyrard in Digital Preservation Metadata for Practitioners, 2016). Karl earned
      his BA in History of Art from Haverford College and his MS in Library and Information
      Science from Drexel University.\n\nSamantha Abrams is Web Resources Collection
      Librarian at Ivy Plus Libraries, where she coordinates the partnership's Web
      Resources Collection Program. Now in its first year, the Program is a collaborative
      collection development effort to build curated, thematic collections of freely
      available, but at-risk, web content in order to support research at thirteen
      participating Ivy Plus Libraries and beyond. Before Ivy Plus Libraries, Samantha
      worked at StoryCorps, where she managed the organization's digital and physical
      assets, including born-digital audio and photos, physical paperwork, and electronic
      databases. Samantha has additional experience working in public libraries, publishing,
      and as a corporate archivist for the fast-casual restaurant chain Culver's.
      She is the current Social Media Coordinator for the Society of American Archivists'
      Web Archiving Section, and in 2014 she was awarded the Future Steward Award
      by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance, which recognizes emerging leaders
      taking a creative approach to advancing the knowledge of digital preservation
      issues and practices. Samantha earned her Bachelor's in English from the University
      of Iowa, and her Master's in Library and Information Studies from the University
      of Madison-Wisconsin.\n\n\n"

      Web Archiving for All! An Introduction to Webrecorder
      In this session, we will talk about ways to collect web content via free, open source software that runs in a web browser (Webrecorder.io). With a model of human-directed collecting (one page at a time), Webrecorder significantly lowers the barrier to collecting web content. Attendees will be given a high-level overview of Webrecorder’s features and engage in hands-on activities.

      Web archiving is important to the library/information field because, while so much contemporary culture takes shape or only exists online, this information is very susceptible to frequent change and loss. Selecting and collecting from social media will be important to represent current culture in New York and well beyond in the near and distant future. Many resources collected by libraries and archives, such as annual reports and course catalogs, are often no longer published on paper, but do get published to the web, so web archiving is essential to maintain or extend certain collections. With a tool like Webrecorder, anyone can get started with web archiving quickly, which is empowering both to information professionals/librarians and the communities they serve (especially if users are given information about using Webrecorder themselves).

      During this session, participants will:


      Learn how to employ user-friendly, open source, browser-based software for archiving web content at no cost (Webrecorder).


      Gain information on options for downloading web archives (WARC files) and get experience with software for accessing web archives (Webrecorder Player).


      Leave with the ability to describe, manage and share their web collections online (via Webrecorder.io).



      No experience is expected or necessary. If you can browse the web you can collect with Webrecorder!

      What to bring:

      A laptop (or click here to borrow one of METRO's PC laptops for $5.00). Please have Firefox or Chrome installed. Installing Webrecorder Player, which is freely available from Github, would be helpful but is not required.


      Agenda:


      Hour 1:



      Introductions, participants share goals/anticipated use cases


      Overview of Webrecorder.io’s core tool sets followed by question time and brief discussion


      Hands on activity to sign up for account, capture sample collection and review sample collection


      Participants check back with group to discuss/reflect on progress



      Hour 2:



      Prompts or questions will be given to help participants envision how they could form meaningful small scale collections or augmentations to larger collections then start forming those collections while in this workshop. This can be done individually or in groups of 2-3 if participants would like to team up


      Introduction to using pre-configured (remote) browsers and importing from public web archives


      Overview of description, management and sharing features followed by an exercise to use these tools



      Hour 3:



      Demo of Webrecorder Player, an application for accessing/interacting with WARC files offline. Collections created earlier in the workshop can be downloaded and viewed in Webrecorder Player


      Discuss the components of the practice of web archiving and explore how they could fit into existing and emerging digital preservation workflows through discussion  


      If any time remains it can be used for further discussions, Q&A and/or ‘lab time’
