    text: |-
      From the news that earth surface temperatures hit a record high in 2016, to a presidential administration that denies the effect fossil fuels play in climate change, we are inundated with stories and images about climate change. And yet authentic face-to-face conversations about climate change (with family, friends, neighbors, colleagues) are rare. According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, “more than half of those who are interested in global warming or think the issue is important ‘rarely’ or ‘never’ talk about it with family and friends.” 
      In this workshop, participants will learn why dialogue about climate change is critical to creating a brighter future, and how librarians can facilitate dialogues that empower our communities to be better equipped to respond, adapt, and mitigate the effects.This interactive, experiential training will guide you through the creation of a “Climate Communications Toolbox” you can use to facilitate dialogue and host “Climate Conversations” within your library community. You will:


      Learn how to create and host “Climate Conversations” at your library.


      Share ideas for archiving and exhibiting artifacts created in workshops.


      Brainstorm ideas for building community partnerships.


      Learn why resilience and social capital are critical for communities to thrive and endure, and how libraries can help communities build both.


      Experience mindfulness exercises as a tool for “re-wiring” the brain to stabilize the nervous system.


      Explore your own thoughts and feelings about climate change through storytelling and reflective writing.

      Join us for a presentation and Q & A on an Aarhus Library project that uses design thinking tools to co-create mobile library units that meet citizens where they are.
      Helene Bruhn Schvartzman, Project Manager & Consultant on Civic Engagement at Aarhus Public Libraries will discuss how the mobile units served as mobile platforms for dialogue about, and observation of, needs and resources in local communities. 
      This talk will tackle the following questions:


      How might design thinking methods be a motor for creating dynamic and empathic library services?


      How might we “do library” close to, and together with, citizens and partners?


      How might the library become more agile and flexible to meet and understand the needs of non-users?


      This talk is presented free of charge. Breakfast snacks and coffee will be provided.

      Reference in Trumps America<br/>Wednesday, May 10th, 2017; 10am - 12pm</b></p>
      <p>We welcome submissions for Lightning Round presentations on the theme of
      Urgent Reference in a post-Trump climate.</p> <p>Students and patrons are approaching
      the reference desk at a time abuzz with questions of misinformation &amp; disinformation
      &amp; accusations of “fake news” &amp; “alternative facts.” Providing reference
      has become differently urgent as the stakes for a Critical Information Literacy
      -  for an informed citizenry at a time when the very definitions of “information”
      and “literacy” are called into question - are suddenly, jarringly high.</p>
      <p>This spring the METRO Reference SIG will focus on Reference Work in this
      new climate. We believe that Reference Librarianship, in particular, is now,
      and has always been an avenue for “care work.”  We seek to create a climate
      to come together and discuss our practice, showcase tools for research, interrogate
      systemic and evolving needs and to brainstorm and support one another in finding
      solutions.</p> <p><b>Urgent Reference as it relates to:</b></p> <p>• News related
      to the Trump administration in general</p> <p>• Healthcare/Affordable Care Act </p>
      <p>• Issues on Immigration Legislation </p> <p>• Executive Orders and governmental
      procedures </p> <p>• Working through “fake news” /”alternative” “facts” with
      students </p> <p>• Determining the best ways to supply students with tools for
      informed responses, etc.</p> <p><b>We consider Urgent Reference to mean reference
      work that directly:</b></p> <p>• Seeks to uncover current events </p> <p>• Sources
      news and various forms of media </p> <p>• Can differentiate between Right and
      Left politics </p> <p>• Provides support to vulnerable communities </p> <p>• Provides
      support to activist communities </p> <p>• Provides Critical Data Literacy </p>
      <p>• Has a hand on the pulse of controversy</p> <p>Presentations should be 10
      minutes each.  A group discussion will follow the presentations. Send one paragraph
      descriptions of your presentation, detailing topics covered and if you will
      have slides to kadler@mcny.edu &amp; ssmith4@gc.cuny.edu by April 30th 2016.<br/>Confirmations
      will arrive by May 5th, 2017. </p> "
