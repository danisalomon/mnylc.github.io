      Do you face challenging behavior from library users? 
      Would you like to change, develop, or enhance relationships with patrons, colleagues, or stakeholders?

      This session explores the use of simple, inexpensive, and effective activities that build empathy, highlight obstacles to change, and help participants to find common ground for future action. We'll highlight the elements of scenario planning, collaboration, and storytelling that underpin those activities.

      Participants will:


      learn to use open-ended play activities including Library Island to elicit new ideas, highlight challenges, and develop relationships


      create a tailored roleplay of their own


      explore follow-up activities that turn play into practical outcomes


      Participants will receive a follow-up packet with additional resources, hints, and tips.

      Testimonials“Matt’s ‘Battle for Library Island’ roleplaying event opened many minds to the challenges and tensions of library service, allowing both brand-new personnel from the finance department, and old public service hands who thought they fully understood their work, to rapidly see things they do every day from a totally different perspective.”– Eli Neiburger, Deputy Director Ann Arbor District Library, Michigan, USA“Matt is a great facilitator, with his warmth and enthusiasm he draws participants to challenge their thinking, to espouse a different perspective and to really stretch their imagination in a safe environment. His “Battle for Library Island” challenged people’s minds to see the ‘other side’ to understand the challenges of higher level management, the tension of limited resources and budget constraints. It made people see the day to day things we do in a different light. ” 
      – Javed Khan, Engagement Coordinator (Planning, Engagement, and Reform) – Metro South Health Board, Queensland, Australia

      Join us for an evening tour of the Interference Archive!
      The mission of Interference Archive is to explore the relationship between cultural production and social movements. This work manifests in an open stacks archival collection, publications, a study center, and public programs including exhibitions, workshops, talks, and screenings, all of which encourage critical and creative engagement with the rich history of social movements.
      The archive contains many kinds of objects that are created as part of social movements by the participants themselves: posters, flyers, publications, photographs, books, T-shirts and buttons, moving images, audio recordings, and other materials.
      Through our programming, we use this cultural ephemera to animate histories of people mobilizing for social transformation.  We consider the use of our collection to be a way of preserving and honoring histories and material culture that is often marginalized in mainstream institutions.
      This event is open to METRO members only. If you'd like to join METRO, please visit metro.org/join.


      We are offering this event free of charge; participants are encouraged to bring along a small cash donation to help support the Interference Archive's work.
