      Recognize structures of gender inequity in the workplace
      Communicate their value to coworkers, supervisors, and patrons
      Practice empathy and flexibility in everyday conversations

    text: |-
      Using New York City’s own open data portal as a teaching example, participants will be introduced to open data as a reference and research tool. Together we will practice effective search strategies, explore use cases, and build skills in critical evaluation. Through discussion, we will explore explicit and implicit biases, identify data quality issues, and consider how data, like all sources of information, requires a certain level of scrutiny. 
      Participants will:

      explore ways in which patrons can access, understand, and create with open data
      learn search strategies for finding usable datasets on NYC Open Data
      download a dataset to explore in Google Sheets.  

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.

      Join us for an interactive workshop on combating “fake news” and promoting media literacy in the “post-truth” era. We will discuss our experiences leading an information literacy teach-in titled “Don’t Take the Clickbait: Practical Ways to Recognize and Fight Fake News” at Purchase College, SUNY. We will also invite participants to share their experiences and brainstorm ways to engage patrons from a variety of backgrounds and political orientations. This workshop aims to offer solutions for fighting the spread of “fake news,” rather than merely identifying the problem.
       At the end of this workshop, participants will have the tools to:

      Use hands-on activities to promote critical thinking about news sources
      Help and encourage library patrons to fight the spread of fake news and misinformation
      View  “fake news” programming through the lens of critical literacy and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy

      Participants will gain hands-on exposure to the fundamentals of data visualization, and create their own data viz using a dataset from the NYC Open Data portal.
      Together we’ll explore CARTO and Google Sheets, free tools for creating charts, graphs and maps. We’ll discuss best practices for information visualization, how to critically evaluate the charts and graphs you see in news stories, and how to enable patrons to use these resources and build data visualization skills.
      Participants will:

      explore user interfaces for creating data visualizations in CARTO and Google Sheets
      download a dataset from NYC Open Data
      create meaningful visualizations 

      Pizza, salad, and beverages will be provided at this workshop.
      About our instructor:
      Julia Marden is a data librarian and consultant, with a decade of experience working at the intersection of civic technology, education, and community engagement. Her company, Tiny Panther Consulting, works with socially-minded organizations to implement inclusive and equitable data strategies. She commutes around NYC on a glitter purple bicycle, on a quest to demystify data and upset the balance of power in data-driven research.
