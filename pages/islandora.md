METRO uses [Islandora,](http://islandora.ca) an open-source software configuration that uses Drupal, Solr, and Fedora. Islandora is designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. METRO is a member of the Islandora Foundation and is an active participant in the Islandora open-source community. 

METRO works with our member organizations to develop digital asset management solutions based on Islandora that fit almost any use case. 

With our baseline solution, all of your digital assets are made available as part of a shared repository called the Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York, or [DCMNY.](http://dcmny.org/browse) DCMNY currently provides access to dozens of METRO members’ digital collections. In addition, DCMNY is an easy on-ramp to the DPLA, meaning the content is discoverable in this greater national context as well.

In addition to our baseline solution, we can also design a customized service plan based on your organization’s resources and needs. METRO never writes any proprietary or hidden code, and we always give you full access to your own system.
