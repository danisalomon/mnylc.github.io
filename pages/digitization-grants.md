In January 2005, METRO launched its Digitization Grant Program as an effort to support digitization projects involving significant collections held by METRO member libraries in New York City and Westchester County. This initiative is supported in part by funds from the New York State Regional Bibliographic Databases Program.

Since that time, METRO has awarded over close to $900,000 in grants to support 92 digital projects.

Funding for digitization projects is distributed annually. For more information and to discuss potential projects and funding opportunities, please contact Anne Karle-Zenith, METRO’s Associate Director of Business Development, at [annekz@metro.org.](mailt:annekz@metro.org)

<b>Institution:</b> Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai<br/>
<b>Collection:</b> <a href="http://dspace.mssm.edu/handle/123456789/31007">Annual Reports of St. Luke's and Roosevelt Hospitals</a><br/>
<b>Description:</b>  This collection includes the Annual Reports for St. Luke's Hospital (1859-1976) and the Roosevelt Hospital (1871-1978).  These two famous New York City medical institutions were both founded in the 19th century to serve the worthy poor in the City.  Both grew to include education in their missions, training both young doctors in their residency programs, as well as nurses in three year diploma programs. Many scientific and clinical innovations occurred at these institutions, but their primary mission was and remains service. The Annual Reports detail the stories of the hospitals: their needs, their supporters, the people they served, and how they interacted with their communities in New York City. The Reports also show the advance of medicine, including information about how the hospitals responded to various epidemics and public health crises, from 19th century cholera to 20th century drug addiction.

<b>Institution:</b> Fordham University<br/>
<b>Collection:</b> <a href="https://cdm17265.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/italianPamp">Political and religious pamphlets of the Italian unification, 1815-1871</a><br/>
<b>Description:</b>  This collection of approximately 1600 short printed pamphlets was published in Italy, largely from 1815-1880, and markings on several of the items appear to link the collection with Cardinal Carlo Luigi Morichini (1805-1879) as a former owner. The pamphlets reflect the Catholic Church's outlook on and response to the sweeping changes occurring in 19th-century Italy, a period which witnessed the national unification of the Italian peninsula and the corresponding secularization of civil, political, and educational institutions.
