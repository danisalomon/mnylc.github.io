METRO partners with New York's libraries, archives, and museums to share our history and treasures with a global audience.

Libraries have spent years making the historical treasures of New York -- its papers, photos and public records -- easier to find by scanning and putting digital copies online. But with so many different websites and databases to turn to, it can be difficult for residents, students, and researchers to uncover the rich history of our state. 

In 2013, the [Empire State Digital Network (ESDN)](http://esdn.metro.org/) was launched at METRO to help the [Empire State Library Network (ESLN)](http://www.esln.org) collect New York Stateâ€™s digital collection materials and bring them all together in one place.

METRO aggregates descriptive metadata from hundreds of libraries, archives, museums, and cultural heritage institutions and shares that data with the [Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).](http://www.dp.la)
