Open to all library staff interested in the coding, deployment, and design of library software, systems, and web services. This local chapter of Code4Lib, known as Code4LibNYC, aspires to channel the spirit of the national organization. We were formerly known as the "Library 2.0" SIG at METRO. We want to provide a forum for software and web developers and programmers, who work at area libraries, to discuss their ongoing projects.

This group provides an opportunity for high school and college librarians to share their experiences. The group will help high school librarians prepare students for college. Academic librarians will gain a better idea of where students are coming from and how they can help.

Through conversation, this SIG will work to ease studentsâ€™ transition between high school and college. Topics of discussion and presentations include college readiness, the first year college experience, and enhancing critical thinking. Librarians from public and independent schools, college, and universities, as well as support staff, are welcome.

Diana Moronta and Julia Marden, Co-organizers

The Social Justice Special Interest Group welcomes all librarians, archivists, and other information professionals who are interested in activities on community-centered activism, social movements, and outreach. Through meetings, presentations, discussion groups, and other events, we will reflect on and rethink the intersections of libraries and archives with social justice struggles. Some questions we will explore include: How do the ways we preserve, analyze, document and mobilize our collections, instruction, and services connect with the work of community activists in their fights for racial, economic, and gender justice? What does it mean to have a commitment to social justice in our profession and practice? How does librarianship embrace, challenge, or hinder various forms of access to information, documentation, and archives?
