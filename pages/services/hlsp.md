The METRO Hospital Library Services Program (HLSP) supports the work of more than 65 hospital and medical center libraries in New York City and Westchester County. We seek to develop, enhance, and improve the delivery of healthcare information between member libraries and health care professionals. We use outreach and targeted support to make sure that local hospital and medical center libraries apply for any grants for which they are eligible. 

METRO services to hospital and medical center libraries include:

- Information about grants and other funding opportunities
- Continuing education, including courses offering Medical Library Association credits
- An annual conference session focused on current issues related to health and medical library issues
- Free or discounted access to databases 

For more information about our HLSP program, please contact Susan Klimley, HLSP Program Manager at [sklimley@metro.org](mailto:sklimley@metro.org).

## Grant Opportunities
METRO distributes funds from the New York State Library to support acquisitions, technology upgrades and interlibrary loan services for hospital libraries.

## Collection Development Grants

Collection development grants are available to METRO's Hospital Library Service Program members. Grant amounts are based on funding available, established need, and current expenditure levels. The NYS HLSP guidelines may be found here.

Next application cycle opens Fall 2017.

## Technology Grants
Each year, METRO receives funding to support technology needs in hospital libraries. Grants are available to members of METRO's Hospital Library Services Program. 

The application period and guidelines are announced each fall. Applications are reviewed by an ad-hoc committee drawn from the HLSP Advisory Council. 

Next application cycle opens Fall 2017.

## Medical Information Service Program Grants

Medical Information Service Program grants are available to subsidize costs associated with interlibrary loans involving medical and health related materials. Grants are available to medical or hospital libraries, though other libraries may also be eligible to have the cost of its health-related interlibrary loans subsidized if the National Library of Medicine (NLM) or a Document Delivery Providers (DDP's) provided them. Grant funding is based, in part, on Docline interlibrary loan statistics.

Next application cycle opens Spring 2018.
