METRO works with libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations to develop digital asset management solutions that fit almost any use case. We use [Islandora,](http://islandora.ca), an open-source software package that uses Drupal, Solr, and Fedora commons. Islandora is designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework. METRO is a member of the Islandora Foundation and is an active contributor to the Islandora open-source community.

Our baseline solution, open to organizations that are METRO members, makes all of your digital assets available as part of a shared repository called the Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York, or [DCMNY.](http://dcmny.org/browse) DCMNY currently provides access to dozens of METRO members’ digital collections. In addition, DCMNY is an easy on-ramp to the DPLA, meaning the content is discoverable in this greater national context as well.

In addition to our baseline solution, we also customize Islandora deployments and offer flexible service plans based on your organization’s resources and needs. We can assist you migrating out of any other repository system, and we make it a priority to offer you a clean exit strategy should you ever choose to leave Islandora for another solution. METRO never writes any proprietary or hidden code, and we not only give you full access to your own system, we offer training oppprtunities so that you take your system in any direction you choose to.

## Featured Projects

### New-York Historical Society (N-YHS)

We helped N-YHS migrate an older Islandora instance and then built and deployed a new, faster, scalable configuration. METRO provided in depth training for both IT staff and collections administrators to assure a simple handoff.

### Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York (DCMNY)

DCMNY is a shared repository that we make available to METRO members who need to host their digital assets somewhere, but do not feel they need their own unique system.
