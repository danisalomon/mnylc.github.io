### If you are using your own computer

You are welcome to bring your own machine and plug into the cutter.

If you are an open source wizard and you want to be set up with entirely free tools to draw and then cut, check out [Inkscape]() and [InkCut]().

Otherwise, you'll need to get the [Cutting Master 3 plugin](http://www.graphtecamerica.com/graphtec-america-support-downloads-cutting-plotters-ce6000-series) for Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw.

### If you are using our setup

You will have access to Adobe Illustrator and Cutting Master 3. Here is a tutorial on how this software works.
